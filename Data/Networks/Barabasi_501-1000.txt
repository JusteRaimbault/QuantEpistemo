The essence of such variation is that the assessment actually changes with available information. The relevant 'information' is clarified here and simply divided into two categories, i.e. the basic properties of the network together with the hazards and the real performance of part of the network. Correspondingly, approaches to an assessment with different categories of information are identified, and the framework for an information-dependent seismic reliability assessment is formulated. The basis for such information-dependent assessment is the description of the dependence structure of the seismic performance of bridges. Here, a correlation model that covers different aspects relevant to bridge performance is derived to play such role and is combined with the fragility analysis of individual bridges to realise the network reliability assessment and the importance measure of components in the priority of information collection. The proposed framework, together with the correlation model, is demonstrated in an example of a traffic network that connects 8 cities by highways with 12 standard reinforced-concrete overpass bridges in California.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0141-0296	1873-7323		WOS:000451497900026		J	Bandyopadhyay, Antar; Kaur, Gursharn								LINEAR DE-PREFERENTIAL URN MODELS								ADVANCES IN APPLIED PROBABILITY				50	4			1176	1192		10.1017/apr.2018.55					DEC 2018	2018	In this paper we consider a new type of urn scheme, where the selection probabilities are proportional to a weight function, which is linear but decreasing in the proportion of existing colours. We refer to it as the de preferential urn scheme. We establish the almost-sure limit of the random configuration for any balanced replacement matrix R. In particular, we show that the limiting configuration is uniform on the set of colours if and only if R is a doubly stochastic matrix. We further establish the almost-sure limit of the vector of colour counts and prove central limit theorems for the random configuration as well as for the colour counts.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0001-8678	1475-6064		WOS:000451616400007		J	Sun, Ruoxi; Ye, Jing; Tang, Ke; Zhang, Kai; Zhang, Xin; Ren, Yong								Big Data Aided Vehicular Network Feature Analysis and Mobility Models Design								MOBILE NETWORKS & APPLICATIONS				23	6	SI		1487	1495		10.1007/s11036-017-0981-z					DEC 2018	2018	Vehicular networks play a pivotal role in intelligent transportation system (ITS) and smart city (SC) construction, especially with the coming of 5G. Mobility models are crucial parts of vehicular network, especially for routing policy evaluation as well as traffic flow management. The big data aided vehicle mobility analysis and design attract researchers a lot with the acceleration of big data technology. Besides, complex network theory reveals the intrinsic temporal and spatial characteristics, considering the dynamic feature of vehicular network. In the following content, a big GPS dataset in Beijing, and its complex features verification are introduced. Some novel vehicle and location collaborative mobility schemes are proposed relying on the GPS dataset. We evaluate their performance in terms of complex features, such as duration distribution, interval time distribution and temporal and spatial characteristics.

The problem encountered in existing metrics is whether to use the approach of measuring a single type of information or measuring the overall information; however, redundancy can be calculated. In view of these problems, this article selects three types of information metrics that express compactness, heterogeneity, and discreteness in a network topology. The measurement model has been simplified, and the calculation has been improved. By comparing various methods and measuring the information entropy of area road networks, the simplicity and validity of the improved method are verified.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1361-1682	1467-9671		WOS:000452872300015		J	Liao, Chien Hsiang; Chen, Mu-Yen					Chen, Mu-Yen/0000-0002-3945-4363			Exploring knowledge patterns of library and information science journals within the field: a citation analysis from 2009 to 2016								SCIENTOMETRICS				117	3			1991	2008		10.1007/s11192-018-2925-1					DEC 2018	2018	A substantial number of studies have examined the journal quality and ranked them using academic survey, scientometric indicator, or citation analysis. This study aims to investigate library and information science (LIS) journal impact from a different perspective: the knowledge contribution to peer journals in the LIS field. The data are selected from the SSCI and SCI databases by Thomson Reuters from 2009 to 2016. Based on the criterion that the journal has at least 6years of citation data, a total of 26 LIS-related journals were selected for this study. These journals are divided into four quadrants according to their knowledge impact on peer journals. This study not only uses social network analysis to investigate the citation patterns among the journals and rank the journals based on different structural characteristics in the network but also examines the formation of subfields through clustering analysis. The findings suggest research avenues for LIS scholars and journal editors, such as identifying research subgroups and formulating strategies for LIS journal development.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000451754600030		J	Jiang, Fan; Liu, Niancai								The hierarchical status of international academic awards in social sciences								SCIENTOMETRICS				117	3			2091	2115		10.1007/s11192-018-2928-y					DEC 2018	2018	International academic awards are not only compelling signs of personal academic excellence, but also play a significant role in evaluating the performance of institutions and countries. However, limited literature about awards in social sciences means that many major international academic awards are still unrecognized. Here we collect 180 international academic awards in eight subjects and gauge their relative reputations through online surveys. Moreover, we visualize the awards network based on the relative reputation scores and the number of co-awardees among them by using Gephi software. Finally, we adopt a statistical approach to analyze the structure of the awards network and find that the co-awardee frequencies follow a power-law distribution, which indicates that the awards network is a scale-free network. Our result suggests that a hierarchical status exists among international academic awards in social sciences, which may help us enhance the understanding of the Matthew effect in the academic awards system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000451754600037		J	Huang, Yong; Bu, Yi; Ding, Ying; Lu, Wei								Number versus structure: towards citing cascades								SCIENTOMETRICS				117	3			2177	2193		10.1007/s11192-018-2952-y					DEC 2018	2018	This paper proposes a novel concept of the citing cascade, defined as a network comprising citing relationships between a paper and its citing paper, as well as those among its citing papers. Compared with citation counts using a single number, citing cascades reveal the structural information of citation networks of a scientific publication and thus help us better understand the citation impact of a scientific publication (called the owner of the citing cascade). We then define and elaborate on several basic and advanced properties of citing cascades. By employing computer science publication records in the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset, we found that cascade size, edge count, in-degree, and out-degree all follow typical power law distributions with various exponential parameters (). In addition, cascade depth is observed to follow an exponential distribution. We also examine the relation between citation count of the owner and some advanced properties that we defined. Many related future studies are also illustrated at the end of this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000451754600043		J	Wegner, Anatol E.; Ospina-Forero, Luis; Gaunt, Robert E.; Deane, Charlotte M.; Reinert, Gesine					Deane, Charlotte/0000-0003-1388-2252; Ospina-Forero, Luis/0000-0003-2941-6336			Identifying networks with common organizational principles								JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS				8	6			887	913		10.1093/comnet/cny003					DEC 2018	2018	Many complex systems can be represented as networks, and the problem of network comparison is becoming increasingly relevant. There are many techniques for network comparison, from simply comparing network summary statistics to sophisticated but computationally costly alignment-based approaches. Yet it remains challenging to accurately cluster networks that are of a different size and density, but hypothesized to be structurally similar. In this article, we address this problem by introducing a new network comparison methodology that is aimed at identifying common organizational principles in networks. The methodology is simple, intuitive and applicable in a wide variety of settings ranging from the functional classification of proteins to tracking the evolution of a world trade network.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000452655400004		J	Ribeiro, Haroldo, V; Alves, Luiz G.

We analyse well-documented political corruption scandals in Brazil over the past 27 years, focusing on the dynamical structure of networks where two individuals are connected if they were involved in the same scandal. Our research reveals that corruption runs in small groups that rarely comprise more than eight people, in networks that have hubs and a modular structure that encompasses more than one corruption scandal. We observe abrupt changes in the size of the largest connected component and in the degree distribution, which are due to the coalescence of different modules when new scandals come to light or when governments change. We show further that the dynamical structure of political corruption networks can be used for successfully predicting partners in future scandals. We discuss the important role of network science in detecting and mitigating political corruption.									4	0	0	2	0	4			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000452655400009		J	Du, Wenbo; Zhang, Mingyuan; Ying, Wen; Perc, Matjaz; Tang, Ke; Cao, Xianbin; Wu, Dapeng				Perc, Matjaz/A-5148-2009	Perc, Matjaz/0000-0002-3087-541X			The networked evolutionary algorithm: A network science perspective								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				338				33	43		10.1016/j.amc.2018.06.002					DEC 1 2018	2018	The evolutionary algorithm is one of the most popular and effective methods to solve complex non-convex optimization problems in different areas of research. In this paper, we systematically explore the evolutionary algorithm as a networked interaction system, where nodes represent information process units and connections denote information transmission links. Within this networked evolutionary algorithm framework, we analyze the effects of structure and information fusion strategies, and further implement it in three typical evolutionary algorithms, namely in the genetic algorithm, the particle swarm optimization algorithm, and in the differential evolution algorithm. Our results demonstrate that the networked evolutionary algorithm framework can significantly improve the performance of these evolutionary algorithms. Our work bridges two traditionally separate areas, evolutionary algorithms and network science, in the hope that it promotes the development of both. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The discrete-time stochastic dynamical networks under consideration are quite general that account for asymmetric coupling configuration, nonlinear inner coupling structures as well as nonidentical exogenous disturbances. By resorting to both the error bound and the synchronization probability, a notion of quasi-synchronization in probability is first introduced to assess the synchronization performance of the addressed CDNs. An event-triggered pinning feedback control strategy is adopted to control a small fraction of the network nodes with hope to reduce the frequency of updating and communication in the control process while preserving the desired dynamical behaviors of the controlled networks. By using the Lyapunov function method and the stochastic analysis techniques, a general framework is established within which the problems of dynamics analysis and controller synthesis are solved for the closed-loop stochastic dynamical networks. Two numerical examples and their simulations are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and the usefulness of our theoretical results.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2162-237X	2162-2388		WOS:000451230100002	29994101	J	Chalupa, David; Hawick, Ken A.; Walker, James A.								Hybrid Bridge-Based Memetic Algorithms for Finding Bottlenecks in Complex Networks								BIG DATA RESEARCH				14				68	80		10.1016/j.bdr.2018.04.001					DEC 2018	2018	We propose a memetic approach to find bottlenecks in complex networks based on searching for a graph partitioning with minimum conductance. Finding the optimum of this problem, also known in statistical mechanics as the Cheeger constant, is one of the most interesting NP-hard network optimisation problems. The existence of low conductance minima indicates bottlenecks in complex networks. However, the problem has not yet been explored in depth in the context of applied discrete optimisation and evolutionary approaches to solve it. In this paper, the use of a memetic framework is explored to solve the minimum conductance problem. The approach combines a hybrid method of initial population generation based on bridge identification and local optima sampling with a steady-state evolutionary process with two local search subroutines. These two local search subroutines have complementary qualities. Efficiency of three crossover operators is explored, namely one-point crossover, uniform crossover, and our own partition crossover. Experimental results are presented for both artificial and real-world complex networks. Results for Barabasi-Albert model of scale-free networks are presented, as well as results for samples of social networks and protein-protein interaction networks. These indicate that both well-informed initial population generation and the use of a crossover seem beneficial in solving the problem in large-scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

These groups are then selected as recipients in lieu of or in addition to users. However, keeping named groups up to date is a difficult and error-prone task when conducted manually. Past schemes automating this task make different tradeoffs and can be distinguished based on several factors including the types of named groups they consider, whether they evolve a specific group or a set of multiple groups, and how integrated they are with techniques for predicting initial groups. We analyze these approaches and identify a design space of potential evolutionary approaches. Using this analysis, we introduce a novel approach for automatically suggesting a sub-type of evolution, evolutionary growth. This approach (a) requires no prior knowledge of which groups change, (b) composes, and therefore interoperates, with an existing engine for recommending named groups, and (c) extracts groups from the social graph of multiple types of applications regardless of whether the graph are explicit or derived implicitly from message communication. Our evaluation considers social graphs created using explicit and implicit connections, and identifies the conditions under which the approach outperforms baseline techniques.					16th European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work - The International Venue on Practice-Centred Computing and the Design of Cooperation Technologies (ECSCW)16th European Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work - The International Venue on Practice-Centred Computing and the Design of Cooperation Technologies (ECSCW)	JUN 04-08, 2018JUN 04-08, 2018		Nancy, FRANCENancy, FRANCE	0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9724	1573-7551		WOS:000441232100022		J	Schlaile, Michael P.; Knausberg, Theresa; Mueller, Matthias; Zeman, Johannes				Schlaile, Michael P./Q-8095-2019	Schlaile, Michael P./0000-0002-9269-0306; Mueller, Matthias/0000-0001-8213-0447			Viral ice buckets: A memetic perspective on the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge's diffusion								COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH				52				947	969		10.1016/j.cogsys.2018.09.012					DEC 2018	2018	This paper presents an exploratory memetic perspective on the diffusion pattern of the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. More precisely, the paper contributes to research on social learning, cultural evolution, and social contagion by shedding light on endogenous (meme-related) as well as exogenous (structural) properties that may have influenced the Ice Bucket Challenge's diffusion. In a first pillar, we present a descriptive memetic analysis of the diffusion pattern, including an evaluation of the Ice Bucket Challenge according to memetic criteria for successful replication. In the second pillar, we present an agent-based simulation model designed to illuminate the influence of particular social network characteristics on the Ice Bucket Challenge's diffusion. By combining these two pillars, we contribute to the advancement of memetic theory, narrowing the gap between a solely meme-centered perspective and social network analysis. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Recent field studies revealed the merging trend of multiple key populations, making HIV intervention difficult because of the existence of multiple transmission modes in such complex multiplex social networks. In this paper, we aim to address this challenge by developing a multiplex social network framework to capture the multimode transmission across two key populations. Based on the multiplex social network framework, we propose a new random search method, named partition-based random search with network and memory prioritization (PRS-NMP), to identify the optimal subset of high-value individuals in the social network for interventions. Numerical experiments demonstrated that the proposed PRS-NMP-based interventions could effectively reduce the scale of HIV transmissions. The performance of PRS-NMP-based interventions is consistently better than the benchmark nested partitions method and network-based metrics.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000450613100014	30010610	J	Bremus, Franziska; Buch, Claudia M.; Russ, Katheryn N.; Schnitzer, Monika				Li, Wang/M-1612-2019				Big Banks and Macroeconomic Outcomes: Theory and Cross-Country Evidence of Granularity								JOURNAL OF MONEY CREDIT AND BANKING				50	8			1785	1825		10.1111/jmcb.12545					DEC 2018	2018	Does the mere presence of big banks affect macroeconomic outcomes?

We demonstrate empirically that the presence of big banks, measured by a high degree of market concentration, is associated with a positive and significant relationship between bank-level credit growth and aggregate growth of credit or GDP.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-2879	1538-4616		WOS:000450526600004		J	Torra, Vicenc; Jonsson, Annie; Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo; Salas, Julian					Navarro-Arribas, Guillermo/0000-0003-3535-942X			Synthetic generation of spatial graphs								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS				33	12			2364	2378		10.1002/int.22034					DEC 2018	2018	Graphs can be used to model many different types of interaction networks, for example, online social networks or animal transport networks. Several algorithms have thus been introduced to build graphs according to some predefined conditions. In this paper, we present an algorithm that generates spatial graphs with a given degree sequence. In spatial graphs, nodes are located in a space equiped with a metric. Our goal is to define a graph in such a way that the nodes and edges are positioned according to an underlying metric. More particularly, we have constructed a greedy algorithm that generates nodes proportional to an underlying probability distribution from the spatial structure, and then generates edges inversely proportional to the Euclidean distance between nodes. The algorithm first generates a graph that can be a multigraph, and then corrects multiedges. Our motivation is in data privacy for social networks, where a key problem is the ability to build synthetic graphs. These graphs need to satisfy a set of required properties (e.g., the degrees of the nodes) but also be realistic, and thus, nodes (individuals) should be located according to a spatial structure and connections should be added taking into account nearness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-8173	1098-111X		WOS:000448278500004		J	Yoghourdjian, Vahan; Dwyer, Tim; Klein, Karsten; Marriott, Kim; Wybrow, Michael					Wybrow, Michael/0000-0001-5536-7780; Dwyer, Tim/0000-0002-9076-9571			Graph Thumbnails: Identifying and Comparing Multiple Graphs at a Glance								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS				24	12			3081	3095		10.1109/TVCG.2018.2790961					DEC 2018	2018	We propose Graph Thumbnails, small icon-like visualisations of the high-level structure of network data.

We report the results of two user studies. The first study compares Graph Thumbnails to node-link and matrix views for identifying similar graphs.

In this article, we consider the possibility that children are an important source of variability in early vocabulary acquisition in the context of curiosity-driven approaches to language learning. In particular, we review research that supports two interrelated claims: that what children know and what children are interested in interact in shaping what children learn. We suggest that this, as well as the possibility that children are motivated intrinsically to learn language, sets the stage for early vocabulary learning.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1750-8592	1750-8606		WOS:000449689400007		J	Chen, Yan; Qi, Youran; Liu, Qing; Chien, Peter				Li, Wang/M-1612-2019				Sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach to estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks								QME-QUANTITATIVE MARKETING AND ECONOMICS				16	4			409	440		10.1007/s11129-018-9199-z					DEC 2018	2018	The increasing access to large social network data has generated substantial interest in the marketing community. However, due to its large scale, traditional analysis methods often become inadequate. In this paper, we propose a sequential sampling enhanced composite likelihood approach for efficient estimation of social intercorrelations in large-scale networks using the spatial model. Given a known population network, the proposed approach sequentially takes small samples from the network, and adaptively improves model parameter estimates through learnings obtained from previous samples. In comparison to population-based maximum likelihood estimation that is computationally prohibitive when the network size is large, the proposed approach makes it computationally feasible to analyze large networks and provide efficient estimation of social intercorrelations among members in large networks. In comparison to sample-based estimation that relies on information purely from the sample and produces underestimation bias in social intercorrelation estimates, the proposed approach effectively uses information from the population without compromising computation efficiency. Through simulation studies based on simulated networks and real networks, we demonstrate significant advantages of the proposed approach over benchmark estimation methods and discuss managerial implications. We also discuss extension of the proposed approach in the context of an unknown population network structure, as well as in an alternative form of the spatial model.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1570-7156	1573-711X		WOS:000448853700002		J	Fazekas, I.; Noszaly, Cs.; Perecsenyi, A.

In addition, STDP has a significant influence on the effect of CB on MCR. As adjusting rate A(p )of STDP increases, for potassium CB there is proper A(p )by which MCR is most pronounced; however, for sodium CB MCR is reduced. These findings could provide a new insight into effect of CB on information processing in neural systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0219-4775	1793-6780		WOS:000444766200009		J	Tang, Wenchang; Ji, Feng; Tay, Wee Peng				Tay, Wee Peng/A-5110-2011	Tay, Wee Peng/0000-0002-1543-195X			Estimating Infection Sources in Networks Using Partial Timestamps								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY				13	12			3035	3049		10.1109/TIFS.2018.2837655					DEC 2018	2018	We study the problem of identifying infection sources in a network based on the network topology, and a subset of infection timestamps. In the case of a single infection source in a tree network, we derive the maximum likelihood estimator of the source and the unknown diffusion parameters. We then introduce a new heuristic involving an optimization over a parametrized family of Gromov matrices to develop a single source estimation algorithm for general graphs. Compared with the breadth-first search tree heuristic commonly adopted in the literature, simulations demonstrate that our approach achieves better estimation accuracy than several other benchmark algorithms, even though these require more information like the diffusion parameters. We next develop a multiple sources estimation algorithm for general graphs, which first partitions the graph into source candidate clusters, and then applies our single source estimation algorithm to each cluster. We show that if the graph is a tree, then each source candidate cluster contains at least one source. Simulations using synthetic and real networks, and experiments using real-world data suggest that our proposed algorithms are able to estimate the true infection source(s) to within a small number of hops with a small portion of the infection timestamps being observed.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1556-6013	1556-6021		WOS:000434453500008		J	Yan, Yongjie; Yu, Guang; Yan, Xiangbin; Xie, Hui								Community cores expansion for overlapping community detection in complex networks								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	33					1850405	10.1142/S0217984918504055					NOV 30 2018	2018	The identification of communities has attracted considerable attentions in the last few years. We propose a novel heuristic algorithm for overlapping community detection based on community cores in complex networks. We introduce a novel clique percolation algorithm and maximize cliques in the finding overlapping communities (node covers) in graphs. We show how vertices can be used to quantify types of local structure presented in a community and identify group nodes that have similar roles in relation to their neighbors. We compare the approach with other three common algorithms in the analysis of the Zachary's karate club network and the dolphins network.

To take this into account, non-crossing conditions can be imposed to constrain the geometry of networks, which consequently affects how they form, evolve and function. However, these constraints are not included in the theoretical frameworks that are currently used to characterize real networks(5-7). Most tools for laying out networks are variants of the force-directed layout algorithm(8,9)-which assumes dimensionless nodes and links-and are therefore unable to reveal the geometry of densely packed physical networks. Here we develop a modelling framework that accounts for the physical sizes of nodes and links, allowing us to explore how non-crossing conditions affect the geometry of a network. For small link thicknesses, we observe a weakly interacting regime in which link crossings are avoided via local link rearrangements, without altering the overall geometry of the layout compared to the force-directed layout. Once the link thickness exceeds a threshold, a strongly interacting regime emerges in which multiple geometric quantities, such as the total link length and the link curvature, scale with the link thickness. We show that the crossover between the two regimes is driven by the non-crossing condition, which allows us to derive the transition point analytically and show that networks with large numbers of nodes will ultimately exist in the strongly interacting regime. We also find that networks in the weakly interacting regime display a solid-like response to stress, whereas in the strongly interacting regime they behave in a gel-like fashion. Networks in the weakly interacting regime are amenable to 3D printing and so can be used to visualize network geometry, and the strongly interacting regime provides insights into the scaling of the sizes of densely packed mammalian brains.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000451599900052	30487615	J	Singh, Rishi Ranjan; Iyengar, S.

Amongst a plethora of application-specific definitions available in the literature to rank the vertices, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and eigenvector centrality (page-rank) have been the widely applied ones. We are surrounded by networks where information, signal or commodities are flowing through the edges. Betweenness centrality comes as a handy tool to analyze such systems, but computation of these scores is a daunting task in large-size networks. Since computing the betweenness centrality of one node is conjectured to be same as time taken for computing the betweenness centrality of all the nodes, a fast algorithm was required that can efficiently estimate a node's betweenness score. In this paper, we propose a heuristic that efficiently estimates the betweenness score of a given node. The algorithm incorporates a non-uniform node-sampling model which is developed based on the analysis of random Erds-Renyi graphs. We apply the heuristic to estimate the ranking of an arbitrary k vertices, called betweenness-ordering problem, where k is much less than the total number of vertices. The proposed heuristic produces very efficient results even when runs for a linear time in the number of edges. An extensive experimental evidence is presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed heuristic for betweenness estimation and ordering on several synthetic and real-world graphs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000451379500001		J	Broekel, Tom; Mueller, Wladimir								Critical links in knowledge networks - What about proximities and gatekeeper organisations?

By focusing on critical links, as defined in network science, we evaluate these links' properties from the perspective of the proximity and regional gatekeeper literature. We thereby gain insights into likely conditions of their emergence and functions. Moreover, we extend the dyadic perspective on regional gatekeeper organisations and link it more strongly to the network science and proximity framework literature. An empirical study applies these arguments and investigates the proximity characteristics of critical links in 132 technology-specific subsidised knowledge networks in Germany. The results show that critical links tend be formed between regional gatekeepers that offer related knowledge resources. The links bridge institutional distances by utilising the benefits of geographic and social proximity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1366-2716	1469-8390		WOS:000447132100001		J	Nepelski, Daniel; De Prato, Giuditta								The structure and evolution of ICT global innovation network								INDUSTRY AND INNOVATION				25	10			940	965		10.1080/13662716.2017.1343129					NOV 26 2018	2018	We look at the structure and evolution of an information and communication technology (ICT) global innovation network (GIN) by mapping the locations of R&D centres belonging to a group of multinational ICT enterprises. We found that the number of countries and connections have increased in a very short time, and that most of the newcomers have come from Africa, Asia and South America. We show that a country's network position affects the creation and intensity of R&D linkages with other countries in the network. This suggests that the evolution of the ICT GIN is driven by, among other things, the preferential attachment mechanism, i.e. countries tend to connect to those countries which have more links. A country's position in the network also moderates the effect of standard determinants of innovation i, such as geographic distance. Hence, network position explains the creation of R&D linkages between such distant countries as the US, China or India.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1366-2716	1469-8390		WOS:000447132100002		J	Li, Ming-Xia; Xiao, Qiao-Li; Wang, Yue; Zhou, Wei-Xing				Li, Ming-Xia/I-1035-2016; Zhou, Wei-Xing/B-1250-2008	Li, Ming-Xia/0000-0002-0932-4584; Zhou, Wei-Xing/0000-0002-8952-8228			Statistical properties of the mutual transfer network among global football clubs								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	29					1850320	10.1142/S0217979218503204					NOV 20 2018	2018	Football is the most popular sport in the world, and one of the most interesting events is the transferring of football players among various clubs. Based on 470,792 transfer records among 23,605 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a mutual transfer network and investigate its basic topological characteristics related to node degree k, edge weight w and node strength s. We find that the distributions can be well fitted by bimodal distributions for k and s or a power-law tail distribution for w. By studying the features of neighbor nodes or edges, we find that the mutual transfer network exhibits assortative mixing for most nodes or clubs but disassortative for clubs with very large degrees. We also observe nonlinear correlations among the different types of measures. Our work sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of football transfer activities.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000451225000003		J	Nyang'inja, Rachel A.; Angwenyi, David N.; Musyoka, Cecilia M.; Orwa, Titus O.

The basic reproduction number RE is obtained and used to determine whether the disease breaks out in the population and results in an endemic equilibrium or dies out eventually corresponding to a disease-free equilibrium. We carried out an analysis of the model and established the conditions for the local and global stabilities of the disease-free and endemic equilibria points. Using the Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle invariant principle, we found out that the disease-endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable if RE > 1 and unstable otherwise. Numerical simulations are performed to illustrate our theoretical predictions. Both the analytical and numerical results show public health education is a very effective control measure in eradicating jigger infestation in the endemic communities at large.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1687-1847			WOS:000450716700004		J	Tang, Liang-Rui; Yang, Yang; Fan, Bing; Wu, Run-Ze								Mitigation strategies with feedback against cascading failures								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B				91	11					288	10.1140/epjb/e2018-90435-7					NOV 19 2018	2018	Because of the complexity and randomness of cascading failures, it is difficult to eliminate cascading failures and establish a robust network. However, we can sacrifice some unnecessary services to ensure the critical services of the network surviving under the attack. To reduce the impact of cascading failures on network robustness, we introduce and investigate a mitigation strategy with feedback against cascading failures. The mitigation strategy considers the flow dynamic, where the traffic exchanged between a pair of nodes can be adaptively adjusted depending on the changes of the shortest path length and the shortest path number between them. The simulations show that the mitigation strategy can effectively suppress the propagation of cascade. Particularly, there is an optimal feedback coefficient where the network is robust and the network traffic loss is minimal. It is shown to be more effective for suppressing the propagation of the cascade than the recent proposed strategy of mitigation, and under different cascading failure models, it can still suppress the propagation of the cascade well.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-6028	1434-6036		WOS:000450605200003		J	Rysz, Maciej; Pajouh, Foad Mahdavi; Pasiliao, Eduardo L.								Finding clique clusters with the highest betweenness centrality								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				271	1			155	164		10.1016/j.ejor.2018.05.006					NOV 16 2018	2018	This article introduces and studies the most betweenness-central clique problem, which involves finding a clique cluster of maximum betweenness centrality in a connected network. This problem allows one to extend the traditional notion of finding a single most influential (or central) member, to one of identifying central groups whose members collectively satisfy a structural property that is meaningful relative to the underlying system. Among others, betweenness-central cliques find application in corporate, social, communication, power grid, and biological network analysis. In this study, the betweenness centrality measure adopted to define our problem is based on the summation of the percentages representing the ratio of the shortest paths between every pair of vertices in a network that intersect a given clique. The decision version of this problem is proven to be NP-complete, and it is shown that an optimal solution to this problem is either a maximal clique, or contained in a maximal clique with the same objective value. We also propose an analytical upper bound for the betweenness centrality of any maximal clique containing a given clique, and employ it to develop a combinatorial branch-and-bound algorithm for solving this problem. Computational performance of the proposed algorithm is then compared with that of a mixed integer programming technique on a test-bed of randomly generated graphs and real-life power-law networks.

Recently, various structure-based similarity methods have been proposed. However, most path-dependent methods merely pay attention to the contributions of paths with specific length, which neglects the interactions of paths with different length for performance improvement. Motivated by the resource-traffic flow mechanism on networks, we measure the interaction relationship of paths with a resource receiving process. In this process, each node takes certain initial resources quantified by its H-index, and then the intermediate nodes on paths can receive resources from their neighbours. Based on this process, a local path-based link predictor which emphasizes the effect of the Resources from Short Paths (RSP) is proposed. Experiments on twelve real-world networks demonstrate that the RSP index has better performance than other nine structure-based similarity methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This method is a type of chain referral (or snowball) sampling in which an estimator is used to infer the proportion of the population with that property. Existing RDS estimators are asymptotically unbiased based on various underlying assumptions. However, these assumptions are often violated in practice, and little attention has been given to violation of one of these assumptions on accurately reporting the degree by all nodes. In this paper, we address the violation of this assumption and propose a new estimator based on fuzzy computing. In particular, the number of an individual's contacts can be a fuzzy concept. Using fuzzy functions, we transform the reported degrees to fuzzy numbers and estimate the infection prevalence in the hidden population by the proposed estimator. We simulate RDS method under the condition that all assumptions are satisfied except the one for the degree, and then evaluate the proposed estimator in synthetic and real datasets. Our results show that the fuzzy-based estimator can reduce the sampling bias kin average 54% as compared to the existing methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Researchers have considered many different realistic network structures such as scale-free networks, spatial networks, and more. However, thus far no study has analyzed a system of hierarchical community structure of many networks. For example, infrastructure across cities is likely distributed with nodes tightly connected within small neighborhoods, somewhat less connected across the whole city, and even fewer connections between cities. Furthermore, while previous work identified interconnected nodes, those nodes with links outside their neighborhood, to be more likely to be attacked or to fail, in a hierarchical structure nodes can be interconnected in different layers (between neighborhoods, between cities, etc.). We consider here the case where the nodes with interconnections at the highest level of the hierarchy are most likely to fail, followed by those with interconnections at the next level, etc. This is because nodes at higher levels of the hierarchy have the longest links as well as having more flow passing through them. We develop an analytic solution for percolation of both single and interdependent networks of this structure and verify our theory through simulations. We find that, depending on the number of levels in the hierarchy, there may be multiple transitions in the giant component (fraction of connected nodes), as the network separates at the various levels. Our results show that these multiple jumps are a feature of hierarchical networks and can affect the vulnerability of infrastructure networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000450141800004		J	Croce, Pierpaolo; Quercia, Angelica; Costa, Sergio; Zappasodi, Filippo					Croce, Pierpaolo/0000-0001-7279-3052			Circadian Rhythms in Fractal Features of EEG Signals								FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY				9						1567	10.3389/fphys.2018.01567					NOV 12 2018	2018	Time-of-day modulations affect both performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks and electrical activity of the brain, as recorded by electroencephalography (EEG). The aim of this work was to identify fluctuations of fractal properties of EEG time series due to circadian rhythms. In twenty-one healthy volunteers (all males, age between 20 and 30 years, chronotype: neutral type) high density EEG recordings at rest in open and closed eyes conditions were acquired in 4 times of the day (8.00 a.m., 11.30 a.m., 2.30 p.m., 7.00 p.m.). A vigilance task (Psychomotor Vigilance Test, PVT) was also performed. Detrended fluctuation Analysis (DFA) of envelope of alpha, beta and theta rhythms was performed, as well as Highuchi fractal dimension (HFD) of the whole band EEG. Our results evidenced circadian fluctuations of fractal features of EEG at rest in both eyes closed and eyes open conditions. Lower values of DFA exponent were found in the time T1 in closed eyes condition, likely effect of the sleep inertia. An alpha DFA exponent reduction was found also in central sensory-motor areas at time T3, the day time in which the sleepiness can be present. In eyes open condition, HFD lowered during the day. In eyes closed condition, an HFD increase was observed in central and frontal regions at time T2, the time in which alertness reaches its maximum and homeostatic sleep pressure is low. Complexity and the persistence of temporal correlations of brain rhythms change during daytime, parallel to changes in alertness and performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-042X			WOS:000449905900001	30483146	J	Zhang, Hui; Shi, Baiying; Yu, Xiaohua; Li, Meiling; Song, Shuguang; Zhao, Quanman; Yao, Xiangming; Wang, Wei								Finding influential nodes in bus networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	28					1850311	10.1142/S0217979218503113					NOV 10 2018	2018	Finding influential nodes is of significance to understand and control the spreading capacity of complex systems. This paper aims to find influential nodes of bus networks by a proposed node failure process. Network efficiency and average transfer times are used to measure the performance of bus networks. Six node measures including degree, node strength, line number, betweenness, local triangle centrality (LTC) and a measure considering neighborhood similarity called LSS are introduced to evaluate the importance of nodes. Results show that removing nodes with high betweenness value can effectively decrease the network efficiency, but cannot increase the average transfer times. Furthermore, removing nodes with high values of LTC and LSS considering the neighborhood information can damage the bus networks from the perspectives of both network efficiency and average transfer times.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000449472600006		J	Kan, Shuang; Lv, Wei; Guo, Fu								Dynamic learning super network modeling of a complex product system based on multi-organization cooperation								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	31					1850375	10.1142/S021798491850375X					NOV 10 2018	2018	Super network modeling has become an effective approach for analyzing complex systems. In this study, a super network is proposed in terms of systems science. A vital aspect of the modeling is the unique dynamic mechanism of the complex system, particularly the preferential mechanism. The preferential mechanism is the driving force of system evolution. However, in current studies, preferential probability has been mostly related to node degree, and there has been little consideration of multi-attribute decision-making based on complex system characteristics (multi-level, multi-traffic, etc.). Furthermore, association analysis of driving forces and the topology structure of the complex system should be highlighted to explore the operating mechanism. In this study, we consider a complex production system (CoPS) as the research object, propose a unique learning motivation mechanism and interaction mechanism of the CoPS, develop a preferential algorithm based on the interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic (IVIUL) operator, and construct a multi-organization knowledge learning super network model. A simulation experiment was conducted to explore the effect of the preferential parameter on learning performance. The results show that the feature of the project team has an important influence on the learning improvement velocity of the super network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000450009500002		J	Turker, Ilker; Albayrak, Zafer								Spreading in scale-free computer networks with improved clustering								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	28					1850309	10.1142/S0217979218503095					NOV 10 2018	2018	In this study, we investigated data spreading in computer networks with scale-free topology under various levels of improved clustering. Starting from a pure Barabasi-Albert (BA) network topology, we applied a Poisson-based rewiring procedure with increasing rewiring probability, which promotes local connections. We then performed wired computer network simulations in NS2 simulator for these topologies. We found that for pure BA network, data transfer (throughput) is maximum, where time required for establishing routing scheme, end-to-end delays in data transmission and number of nodes acting in data transfer are at their minimum levels. Improving clustering increases these parameters those are at their minima. A noteworthy finding of this study is that, for moderate levels of clustering, total throughput remains close to its maximum yielding stable transfer rates, although number of infected nodes and end-to-end delay increase. This indicates that clustering promotes spreading phenomena in networks, although it increases average separation. As a result, clustering property emerges as a catalyzer in data spreading with minimal effects on the total amount of transmission.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000449472600004		J	Finotelli, Paolo; Dipasquale, Ottavia; Costantini, Isa; Pini, Alessia; Baglio, Francesca; Baselli, Giuseppe; Dulio, Paolo; Cercignani, Mara				Pini, Alessia/F-7257-2018	Pini, Alessia/0000-0001-9235-3062			Exploring resting-state functional connectivity invariants across the lifespan in healthy people by means of a recently proposed graph theoretical model								PLOS ONE				13	11					e0206567	10.1371/journal.pone.0206567					NOV 8 2018	2018	In this paper we investigate the changes in the functional connectivity intensity, and some related properties, in healthy people, across the life span and at resting state. For the explicit computation of the functional connectivity we exploit a recently proposed model, that bases not only on the correlations data provided by the acquisition equipment, but also on different parameters, such as the anatomical distances between nodes and their degrees. The leading purpose of the paper is to show that the proposed approach is able to recover the main aspects of resting state condition known from the available literature, as well as to suggest new insights, perspectives and speculations from a neurobiological point of view. Our study involves 133 subjects, both males and females of different ages, with no evidence of neurological diseases or systemic disorders. First, we show how the model applies to the sample, where the subjects are grouped into 28 different groups (14 of males and 14 of females), according to their age. This leads to the construction of two graphs (one for males and one for females), that can be realistically interpreted as representative of the neural network during the resting state. Second, following the idea that the brain network is better understood by focusing on specific nodes having a kind of centrality, we refine the two output graphs by introducing a new metric that favours the selection of nodes having higher degrees. As a third step, we extensively comment and discuss the obtained results. In particular, it is remarkable that, despite a great overlapping exists between the outcomes concerning males and females, some intriguing differences appear. This motivates a deeper local investigation, which represents the fourth part of the paper, carried out through a thorough statistical analysis. As a result, we are enabled to support that, for two special age groups, a few links contribute in differentiating the behaviour of males and females. In addition, we performed an average-based comparison between the proposed model and the traditional statistical correlation-based approach, then discussing and commenting the main outlined discrepancies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000449512300023	30408067	J	Kong, Yunchuan; Yu, Tianwei								A Deep Neural Network Model using Random Forest to Extract Feature Representation for Gene Expression Data Classification								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						16477	10.1038/s41598-018-34833-6					NOV 7 2018	2018	In predictive model development, gene expression data is associated with the unique challenge that the number of samples (n) is much smaller than the amount of features (p). This "n << p" property has prevented classification of gene expression data from deep learning techniques, which have been proved powerful under "n > p" scenarios in other application fields, such as image classification. Further, the sparsity of effective features with unknown correlation structures in gene expression profiles brings more challenges for classification tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose a newly developed classifier named Forest Deep Neural Network (fDNN), to integrate the deep neural network architecture with a supervised forest feature detector. Using this built-in feature detector, the method is able to learn sparse feature representations and feed the representations into a neural network to mitigate the overfitting problem.

In this research, we optimize the topology of non-scale-free networks by turning it into scale-free networks using a nonlinear preferential rewiring method. For different kinds of original networks generated by Watts and Strogatz model, we systematically demonstrate the optimization process and the modified networks to verify the performance of nonlinear preferential rewiring. We conduct further researches to explore the effect of nonlinear preferential rewiring's parameters on performance. Simulation results show that various non-scale-free networks with different network topologies generated by WS model, including random networks and various networks between regular and random, are turned into scale-free networks perfectly by nonlinear preferential rewiring method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1477			WOS:000450108100001		J	Cui, Fang; Hu, Hai-hua; Cui, Wen-tian; Xie, Ying								Seeding strategies for new product launch: The role of negative word-of-mouth								PLOS ONE				13	11					e0206736	10.1371/journal.pone.0206736					NOV 5 2018	2018	When launching a new product, firms often give away free samples to seed the market. This paper aims to identify the optimal seeding targets, such as early adopters, social hubs, or randomly chosen consumers while considering the presence of negative word-of-mouth (WOM). Using agent-based modeling, it was found that seeding early adopters can generate the highest profit and the largest market penetration, followed by the social hubs and random consumers. Moreover, the results show that seeding early adopters can be more beneficial for a low-quality product, wherein adopters are more likely to spread negative WOM. These findings challenge a widely accepted notion in the related research that social hubs are often the most promising targets for seeding programs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000449291400047	30395630	J	Trentin, Edmondo; Di Iorio, Ernesto								Nonparametric small random networks for graph-structured pattern recognition								NEUROCOMPUTING				313				14	24		10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.095					NOV 3 2018	2018	Taking inspiration from the probabilistic principles underlying the topological regularities observed in random networks, the paper presents a simple and efficient Bayesian framework for the classification of (small) labeled random networks. The proposed "graphical model" relies on a Parzen window estimate of the pairwise vertex-vertex probability distribution under an implicit Markov assumption. Experiments show that, in spite of its simplicity, the approach is at least as accurate as the state-of-the-art machines.

Fast lateral inhibition mediated by GABAergic interneurons may implement a winner-takes-all mechanism in the hippocampal input layer. However, it is not clear whether the functional connectivity rules of granule cells (GCs) and interneurons in the dentate gyrus are consistent with such a mechanism. Using simultaneous patch-clamp recordings from up to seven GCs and up to four PV+ interneurons in the dentate gyrus, we find that connectivity is structured in space, synapse-specific, and enriched in specific disynaptic motifs. In contrast to the neocortex, lateral inhibition in the dentate gyrus (in which a GC inhibits neighboring GCs via a PV+ interneuron) is similar to 10-times more abundant than recurrent inhibition (in which a GC inhibits itself). Thus, unique connectivity rules may enable the dentate gyrus to perform specific higher-order computations.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2041-1723			WOS:000449069700009	30389916	J	Garcia-Perez, Guillermo; Angeles Serrano, M.; Boguna, Marian					Garcia-Perez, Guillermo/0000-0002-9006-060X			Soft Communities in Similarity Space								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS				173	3-4	SI		775	782		10.1007/s10955-018-2084-z					NOV 2018	2018	The S-1 model has been central in the development of the field of network geometry. It places nodes in a similarity space and connects them with a likelihood depending on an effective distance which combines similarity and popularity dimensions, with popularity directly related to the degrees of the nodes. The S-1 model has been mainly studied in its homogeneous regime, in which angular coordinates are independently and uniformly scattered on the circle. We now investigate if the model can generate networks with targeted topological features and soft communities, that is, inhomogeneous angular distributions. To that end, hidden degrees must depend on angular coordinates, and we propose a method to estimate them. We conclude that the model can be topologically invariant with respect to the soft-community structure. Our results expand the scope of the model beyond the independent hidden variables limit and can have an important impact in the embedding of real-world networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0022-4715	1572-9613		WOS:000450490500012		J	Lopez-Kidwell, Virginie; Niven, Karen; Labianca, Giuseppe								Predicting workplace relational dynamics using an affective model of relationships								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR				39	9	SI		1129	1141		10.1002/job.2300					NOV 2018	2018	Integrating insights from the organizational social networks and workplace affect literatures, the authors propose a dynamic model of relationships, focusing on the affect experienced within dyadic work relationships to predict their trajectory over time: either improving, declining, or static. The feelings each partner typically experiences within an ongoing relationship (trait relational affect) can be distinguished according to their hedonic tone and activation level, and the combination of both dyadic partners' trait relational affect is predictive of the relationship trajectory. Furthermore, the emotions each partner experiences during specific interactional episodes (state relational affect) can alter and disrupt this relationship trajectory, either temporarily or permanently, to the extent that they diverge from the trait relational affect that is typically experienced. A given relationship trajectory over time leads to the development of different types of informal work ties (strong, negative, or weak), which are associated with a wealth of organizational consequences including effort, motivation, performance, and innovation. The model addresses criticisms that organizational social network research neglects the role of affect and views networks as static entities. The model further provides affect researchers with a novel framework that considers affect as a relational rather than individual phenomenon.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0894-3796	1099-1379		WOS:000449749400007		J	Schecter, Aaron; Pilny, Andrew; Leung, Alice; Poole, Marshall Scott; Contractor, Noshir								Step by step: Capturing the dynamics of work team process through relational event sequences								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR				39	9	SI		1163	1181		10.1002/job.2247					NOV 2018	2018	The emergence of group constructs is an unfolding process, whereby actions and interactions coalesce into collective psychological states. Implicitly, there is a connection between these states and the underlying procession of events. The manner in which interactions follow one another over time describe a group's behavior, with different temporal patterns being indicative of different team characteristics. In this study, we explicitly connect event sequences to the process of emergence. We argue that the temporal relationship between events in a sequence will vary depending on the team's psychological outcome. Further, certain patterns of behavior will be repeated at different rates in teams with varying emergent states. To support this approach, we apply a statistical methodology-relational event modeling-for analyzing sequences of interactions that builds on the foundation of social network analysis. Using a dataset comprised of 55 work teams of military personnel engaged in a tactical scenario, we found that individuals who perceived team process (regarding coordination and information sharing) as having different qualities engaged in significantly different patterns of behavior. Our findings indicate that individuals who had a positive perception of process quality were more likely to initiate communication events in a reciprocal, transitive, and decentralized fashion.									4	0	0	0	0	4			0894-3796	1099-1379		WOS:000449749400009		J	Zhang, Zhicheng; Coenen, Heleen; Ruelens, Philip; Hazarika, Rashmi R.; Al Hindi, Tareq; Oguis, Georgianna K.; Vandeperre, Anja; van Noort, Vera; Geuten, Koen				van Noort, Vera/E-1053-2011	van Noort, Vera/0000-0002-8436-6602; Zhang, Zhicheng/0000-0002-5882-3515; Oguis, Georgianna Kae/0000-0003-4525-1260			Resurrected Protein Interaction Networks Reveal the Innovation Potential of Ancient Whole-Genome Duplication								PLANT CELL				30	11			2741	2760		10.1105/tpc.18.00409					NOV 2018	2018	The evolution of plants is characterized by whole-genome duplications, sometimes closely associated with the origin of large groups of species. The gamma (gamma) genome triplication occurred at the origin of the core eudicots, which comprise similar to 75% of flowering plants. To better understand the impact of whole-genome duplication, we studied the protein interaction network of MADS domain transcription factors, which are key regulators of reproductive development. We reconstructed, synthesized, and tested the interactions of ancestral proteins immediately before and closely after the triplication and directly compared these ancestral networks to the extant networks of Arabidopsis thaliana and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). We found that gamma expanded the MADS domain interaction network more strongly than subsequent genomic events. This event strongly rewired MADS domain interactions and allowed for the evolution of new functions and installed robustness through new redundancy. Despite extensive rewiring, the organization of the network was maintained through gamma. New interactions and protein retention compensated for its potentially destructive impact on network organization. Post gamma, the network evolved from an organization around the single hub SEP3 to a network organized around multiple hubs and well-connected proteins lost, rather than gained, interactions. The data provide a resource for comparative developmental biology in flowering plants.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1040-4651	1532-298X		WOS:000454123800011	30333148	J	Yang, Lu-Xing; Zhang, Tianrui; Yang, Xiaofan; Wu, Yingbo; Tang, Yuan Yan					Yang, Lu-Xing/0000-0002-9229-5787			Effectiveness analysis of a mixed rumor-quelling strategy								JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS				355	16			8079	8105		10.1016/j.jfranklin.2018.07.040					NOV 2018	2018	Circulating the truth and quarantining a subset of rumor spreaders are two major rumor-quelling strategies. In practice, a mixture of the two strategies may be more effective than any one of the two strategies. This paper focuses on effectiveness analysis of the mixed strategy. For this purpose, we are going to establish a rumor-truth competing model on two-layer network. First, we introduce a Markov model characterizing the stochastic dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process, and write the corresponding Kolmogorov model capturing the expected dynamics of the rumor-truth competing process. Second, we give a bilinear model as the first approximation to the Kolmogorov model, and suggest a generic model as a more accurate approximation to the Kolmogorov model. The two models are the focus of concern in this work. For ease in treatment, we describe a limit system of the generic model. By studying the limit model, we present a criterion for the rumor to subside, a criterion for the rumor not necessarily to subside, and a criterion for the rumor to persist, respectively. These findings are instructive to the quelling of false rumors. Finally, through computer experiments we find that when a rumor subsides, the bilinear model is a good approximation to the Kolmogorov model. (C) 2018 The Franklin Institute.

This problem arises especially in large natural and technological networks. To address this issue, we focus on directed networks with linear dynamics and propose an iterative method, termed as "L-0-norm constraint based projected gradient method" (LPGM) in which the input matrix B is involved as a matrix variable. By introducing a chain rule for matrix differentiation, the gradient of the cost function with respect to B can be derived. This allows us to search B by applying probabilistic projection operator between two spaces, i.e., a real valued matrix space R-NxM and a L(0 )norm matrix space R-L0(NxM) by restricting the L-0 norm of B as a fixed value of M. Then, the nodes that correspond to the M nonzero elements of the obtained input matrix (denoted as BL0) are selected as M key nodes, and each external control source is connected to a single key node. Simulation examples in real-life networks are presented to verify the potential of the proposed method. An interesting phenomenon we uncovered is that generally the control cost of scale free (SF) networks is higher than Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks using the same number of external control sources to control the same size of target nodes of networks with the same network size and mean degree. This work will deepen the understanding of optimal target control problems and provide new insights to locate key nodes for achieving minimum-cost control of target nodes in directed networks.

Most notably higher order networks include simplicial complexes formed not only by nodes and links but also by triangles, tetrahedra, etc. More in general, higher-order networks can be cell-complexes formed by gluing convex polytopes along their faces. Interestingly, higher order networks have a natural geometric interpretation and therefore constitute a natural way to explore the discrete network geometry of complex networks. Here we investigate the rich interplay between emergent network geometry of higher order networks and their complexity in the framework of a non-equilibrium model called Network Geometry with Flavor. This model, originally proposed for capturing the evolution of simplicial complexes, is here extended to cell-complexes formed by subsequently gluing different copies of an arbitrary regular polytope. We reveal the interplay between complexity and geometry of the higher order networks generated by the model by studying the emergent community structure and the degree distribution as a function of the regular polytope forming its building blocks. Additionally, we discuss the underlying hyperbolic nature of the emergent geometry and we relate the spectral dimension of the higher-order network to the dimension and nature of its building blocks.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0022-4715	1572-9613		WOS:000459431100001		J	Chen, Ziyu; Deng, Yanchen; Wu, Tengfei; He, Zhongshi								A class of iterative refined Max-sum algorithms via non-consecutive value propagation strategies								AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS				32	6			822	860		10.1007/s10458-018-9395-y					NOV 2018	2018	As an important technique to solve distributed constraint optimization problems, Max-sum has drawn a lot of attention and successfully been deployed in real applications. Unfortunately, Max-sum fails to converge in cyclic problems and usually traverses states with low quality. Max-sum_AD and Max-sum_ADVP were proposed to guarantee the single phase convergence and the cross phase convergence respectively, and greatly improve the solution quality of Max-sum. However, the solution quality is closely related to the timing for starting value propagation in Max-sum_ADVP. In other words, low-quality initial assignments will lead to a poor result. In this paper, we prove that value propagation could restrict the exploration ability brought by Max-sum and eventually makes Max-sum_ADVP equivalent to a sequential greedy local search algorithm. For getting a balance between exploration and exploitation, several non-consecutive value propagation strategies are proposed to relax the restriction caused by value propagation: single-side value propagation which executes value propagation and Max-sum_AD in an interleaved way, probabilistic value propagation which performs value propagation stochastically and hybrid belief/value propagation where agents perform Max-sum_AD and value propagation in one round. We illustrate that agents in our algorithms can make decisions beyond local functions. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our methods over Max-sum and its variants. It also can be found that our methods are independent of the value propagation timing which is a major concern in Max-sum_ADVP.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-2532	1573-7454		WOS:000446664700003		J	Huang, Keke; Liu, Yishun; Zhang, Yichi; Yang, Chunhua; Wang, Zhen				Wang, Zhen/H-5017-2011	Wang, Zhen/0000-0002-8182-2852			Understanding cooperative behavior of agents with heterogeneous perceptions in dynamic networks								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				509				234	240		10.1016/j.physa.2018.06.043					NOV 1 2018	2018	In reality, social diversity is omnipresent. Motivated by the fact that different agents may get different perceptions for the same social dilemma, we extended the concept of heterogeneous perceptions to dynamically varying network and investigate the impact on the evolution of cooperation in this paper. Here, the heterogeneous perceptions of different agents are modeling by spatial multigames, which are characterized by two different social dilemmas: the traditional prisoners' dilemma and the snowdrift game. The dynamic network, on the other hands, is a network whose link weights are coevolved with game strategy. By conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we draw a conclusion that for small temptation a large value of network evolution strength warrants an optimal resolution of social dilemma; while for large temptation an intermediate value of network evolution strength is the most beneficial for the evolution of cooperation. In addition, numerical simulations also indicate that the higher the value of the proportion of the snowdrift game is, the more widespread cooperative behavior becomes except for some small fluctuations. Taken together, our results support that the agents with heterogeneous perceptions in dynamic network are strong facilitators of cooperation promotion, which will provide a new insight for the further research.

In the case of synthetic power grids, topological considerations may be included during the generation process or they may be used as validation criteria once synthetic networks are generated. These synthetic grids can be used as case studies only if their topology is statistically consistent with real power networks. With a view to looking into power-network topology, we analyze the topology of fifteen European transmission networks by using complex-network metrics. The study includes two voltage levels: 400 kV and 200 kV. We study these levels both independently and as a single combined grid. Degree distribution, characteristic path length, network diameter, betweenness centrality and global clustering coefficient are explored in order to understand network topology and to explain observed differences among countries. We analyze empirically whether those metrics scale or not with network size as well as the characterization of power grids as small-world networks. Our conclusions improve the current understanding of power network topology, which is essential for generating synthetic power grids and in the assessment of network robustness.

We assign independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) weights to the edges of the graph. We investigate the weighted distance (the length of the shortest weighted path) between two uniformly chosen vertices, called typical distances. When the underlying age-dependent branching process approximating the local neighborhoods of vertices is found to produce infinitely many individuals in finite time-called explosive branching process-Baroni, Hofstad and the second author showed in Baroni et al. (JAppl Probab 54(1): 146-164, 2017) that typical distances converge in distribution to a bounded random variable. The order of magnitude of typical distances remained open for the tau is an element of(2, 3) case when the underlying branching process is not explosive. We close this gap by determining the first order of magnitude of typical distances in this regime for arbitrary, not necessary continuous edge-weight distributions that produce a non-explosive age-dependent branching process with infinite mean power-law offspring distributions. This sequence tends to infinity with the amount of vertices, and, by choosing an appropriate weight distribution, can be tuned to be any growing function that is O(log log n), where n is the number of vertices in the graph. We show that the result remains valid for the the erased configuration model as well, where we delete loops and any second and further edges between two vertices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4715	1572-9613		WOS:000450490500022	30930482	J	Wang, Shuangyan; Deng, Yunfeng; Li, Ying								Improving short-term information spreading efficiency in scale-free networks by specifying top large-degree vertices as the initial spreaders								ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE				5	11					181137	10.1098/rsos.181137					NOV 2018	2018	The positive function of initially influential vertices could be exploited to improve spreading efficiency for short-term spreading in scale-free networks. However, the selection of initial spreaders depends on the specific scenes. The selection of initial spreaders needs to offer low complexity and low power consumption for short-term spreading. In this paper, we propose a selection strategy for efficiently spreading information by specifying a set of top large-degree vertices as the initially informed vertices. The essential idea behind the proposed selection strategy is to exploit the significant diffusion of the top large-degree vertices at the beginning of spreading. To evaluate the positive impact of initially influential vertices, we first build an information spreading model in the Barabasi-Albert (BA) scale-free network; next, we design 54 comparative Monte Carlo experiments based on a benchmark strategy and the proposed selection strategy in different BA scale-free network structures. Experimental results indicate that (i) the proposed selection strategy can significantly improve spreading efficiency in the short-term spreading and (ii) both network size and number of hubs have a strong impact on spreading efficiency, while the number of initially informed vertices has a weak impact. The proposed selection strategy can be employed in short-term spreading, such as sending warnings or crisis information spreading or information spreading in emergency training or realistic emergency scenes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2054-5703			WOS:000451777500028	30564407	J	Alexandridis, Kostas; Takemura, Shion; Webb, Alex; Lausche, Barbara; Culter, Jim; Sato, Tetsu				Alexandridis, Kostas/B-1199-2008	Alexandridis, Kostas/0000-0002-5728-3430; Sato, Tetsu/0000-0002-4482-8841			Semantic knowledge network inference across a range of stakeholders and communities of practice								ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE				109				202	222		10.1016/j.envsoft.2018.08.026					NOV 2018	2018	This paper provides empirical and experimental assessments of thematic knowledge discourses based on two case studies in the US Virgin Islands and Florida. We utilize a latent semantic indexing analysis over natural language corpus to classify and categorize knowledge categories. We computed TF*IDF scores and associated co-occurrence Jaccard similarity scores to construct semantic knowledge networks. Using network analysis, we computed structural metrics over four composite groups: neighbor-based, centrality, equivalence and position. The analysis show that structural network characteristics of environmental knowledge can exponentially predict associations between knowledge categories. We show that connectivity play a critical role on acquisition, representation, and diffusion patterns of knowledge within local communities. We provide evidence of a global prevalence of a shared knowledge core. We show that core social-ecological attributes of knowledge follow scale-free, power law distributions and stable, equilibrium network structures.

However, much existing literature ignores the dynamic influence of the environment on the diffusion process and the impact of the diffusion process on the environment. Taking the IoT diffusion process in the e-commerce industry as example, we investigate the dynamic interaction between the IoT diffusion process and the external environment, i.e., the adjustment of retail prices and the profit of an online retailer through a simulation model. The simulation model combines the price adjustment mechanism and the diffusion evolution mechanism. We obtain two main conclusions. First, price adjustment of retailers blocks the loT diffusion process, and a higher online shopping disutility level could amplify the impediment influence of price adjustment. Second, the IoT diffusion is of influence on the pricing and profit of the online retailers. The influence type (i.e., positive or neglect, monotonous or non-monotonous) depends on the special circumstance. Under some conditions, a wider diffusion does not inevitably result in a larger profit of the online retailer. This shows us that a wider or faster diffusion is not always better.

Visual network figure presents the change of analysts' network position during the sample period. Moreover, information connection stability is defined to assess network stability, which is negatively correlated with stock market volatility. Empirical results show that analysts with a more central position in the network will get better earnings forecasting performance with less forecasting volatility and higher forecasting accuracy.

We derive the degree distributions of LPHVGs using an iterative LPHVGs construction process. We propose a more intuitive method of reproducing the construction process of limited penetrable horizontal visibility graphs that is simple to calculate. We find that the results confirm the analytical results from previous methods. We then introduce the concept of sequential LPHVG(rho) motifs and present a theoretical way of computing the exact motif profiles associated with unrelated random series. We perform several numerical simulations to further check the accuracy of our theoretical results. Finally we use the analytical results of LPHVG(rho) motif profiles to distinguish among random, periodic, and chaotic signals and find that the frequency of the type-I motif captures sufficient information to easily distinguish among different processes.

In this paper, we perform a detailed investigation on the influence of different node characteristics on the structure of similarity networks, which are constructed based on a unique data set of questionnaires. The basic personal information (including the gender, experience of studying abroad, religion, and registered permanent residence in Shanghai (Shanghai Hukou)) and social positions (including intention of solving social problems, economic wealth, social reputation, and political status) provided in the questionnaires are considered as node characteristics. The similarity networks are built according to the Euclidean distances calculated based on the answer vectors to the questions on personal traits. According to the indicator Theta based on entropy measures, in 87% of tests, the links within the nodes having the same characteristics and between the nodes possessing different characteristics are not randomly connected. We further find that the node characteristics have significant effects on the preference of node in forming links within similarity networks. Our work sheds a new light on understanding the relevance of node characteristics for network structures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, we examine whether the influence of experts is conditioned by the way agents select other agents for knowledge acquisition. In this perspective, we compare the emerging knowledge spread for 5 representative policies for positioning experts, namely: random (at nodes selected with equal probability) and central (at nodes with high centrality: degree, closeness, betweenness, eigen-centrality). Each agent selects an in-neighbor for knowledge acquisition, excluding (filtering out) agents of lower knowledge. As "selections" may be implemented before or after "filtering", we also compare the conventional wisdom of "Selection" before "Filtering" with the reverse order of "Selection" after "Filtering". We perform simulations for the 5 policies of positioning experts in 3 representative classes of networks, namely: random, small-world, and scale free. The key finding is that any policy for positioning experts (even random) in networks where agents "Select" after "Filtering", results in significantly faster knowledge attainment (up to 70%), compared to any policy for positioning experts when agents "Select" before "Filtering". Therefore, "Selecting" after "Filtering" is much more effective Knowledge Management Strategy, compared to just placing experts in key positions, without caring how the agents select other agents for knowledge acquisition.

Many multiplexes are characterized by a significant shared links in different layers. For this new network framework, research efforts have been paid on the study of its topological and dynamical properties. However, in these studies the network structures are mostly simple or specific, and the shared links in different layers has been mostly neglected, despite the fact that it is an ubiquitous phenomenon in most multiplexes. To systemically study multiplex network, a general multiplex network framework is necessary. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to generate a multiplex networks with shared links whose degree correlation functions of all its layers, the nodal degree correlation function between the layers, and the size of the resulting network are all tunable. Moreover, we give an upper bound of the average degree of the resulting network when the degree correlation functions introduced above are given and make efforts to maximize the average nodal degree of the multiplex networks. This algorithm may serve as a good candidate of standard technique for multiplex network generation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, incorporating anatomical knowledge leads to desirable outcomes such as increased accuracy in brain network estimates and greater reproducibility of topological features across scanning sessions. Despite the clear advantages, major challenges persist in integrative analyses including an incomplete understanding of the structure-function relationship and inaccuracies in mapping anatomical structures due to inherent deficiencies in existing imaging technology. This calls for the development of advanced network modeling tools that appropriately incorporate anatomical structure in constructing brain functional networks. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian Gaussian graphical modeling approach which models the brain functional networks via sparse precision matrices whose degree of edge specific shrinkage is a random variable that is modeled using both anatomical structure and an independent baseline component. The proposed approach adaptively shrinks functional connections and flexibly identifies functional connections supported by structural connectivity knowledge. This enables robust brain network estimation even in the presence of misspecified anatomical knowledge, while accommodating heterogeneity in the structure-function relationship. We implement the approach via an efficient optimization algorithm which yields maximum a posteriori estimates. Extensive numerical studies involving multiple functional network structures reveal the clear advantages of the proposed approach over competing methods in accurately estimating brain functional connectivity, even when the anatomical knowledge is misspecified up to a certain degree. An application of the approach to data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) study reveals gender based connectivity differences across multiple age groups, and higher reproducibility in the estimation of network metrics compared to alternative methods.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1053-8119	1095-9572		WOS:000445165600023	30017786	J	Duran, Claudio; Daminelli, Simone; Thomas, Josephine M.; Haupt, V.

As experimental testing of DTIs is costly and time-consuming, computational predictors are of great aid. Here, for the first time, state-of-the-art DTI supervised predictors custom-made in network biology were compared-using standard and innovative validation frameworks-with unsupervised pure topological-basedmodels designed for general-purpose link prediction in bipartite networks. Surprisingly, our results show that the bipartite topology alone, if adequately exploited by means of the recently proposed local-community-paradigm (LCP) theory-initially detected in brain-network topological self-organization and afterwards generalized to any complex network-is able to suggest highly reliable predictions, with comparable performance with the state-of-the-art supervised methods that exploit additional (non-topological, for instance biochemical) DTI knowledge. Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the novel predictions revealed that each class of methods prioritizes distinct true interactions; hence, combining methodologies based on diverse principles represents a promising strategy to improve drug-target discovery. To conclude, this study promotes the power of bio-inspired computing, demonstrating that simple unsupervised rules inspired by principles of topological self-organization and adaptiveness arising during learning in living intelligent systems (like the brain) can efficiently equal perform complicated algorithms based on advanced, supervised and knowledge-based engineering.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1467-5463	1477-4054		WOS:000456689400008	28453640	J	Wang, Hanchen; Sun, Yichun; Zheng, Lei; Du, Wenbo; Li, Yumeng								The public goods game on scale-free networks with heterogeneous investment								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				509				396	404		10.1016/j.physa.2018.06.033					NOV 1 2018	2018	Heterogeneity has received increasing attention over the past decade, and it is widely considered to have a great effect on promoting cooperation. In our paper, we investigate the influence of heterogeneous investment on the cooperative behavior of the system, which is based on the number of players in different groups in the evolutionary public goods game (PGG). A parameter a is used to tune the heterogeneous investment mechanism: if alpha > 0, cooperators invest more in the groups centered on high-degree nodes, but if alpha < 0, the groups centered on small-degree nodes attract more investment from cooperators. Simulation results and analysis suggest that the cooperation level is enhanced in a large range. For a smaller enhancement factor r in the PGG model, the cooperation frequency decreases monotonously with the increase of alpha. For a larger r, the highest cooperation level can only be obtained by alpha = 0, which is a non-monotonous phenomenon. By investigating the mean payoffs of nodes of different degrees for different alpha, it is found that the strategy utilized by hubs is more prominent in the system. Some explanations are provided for the strategy orientation of hubs and show that the investment propensity will change it. Our work may be useful for understanding the influence of individual investment in different groups on the level of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Different from previous studies, we combine the effects of activity rate and infected rate on spreading process. Network nodes become active according to different probability correlated with its degree. Active infected nodes can interact all active susceptible neighbors, meanwhile, recover at a certain probability. By means of the mean-field equations, we find the basic reproductive number and critical threshold of spreading dynamic can be explained by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the correlation matrix. Furthermore, we utilize analytical and numerical simulations to explore the critical phenomenon and spreading dynamics of homogeneous and heterogeneous networks respectively. Our results indicate that both homogeneous networks and heterogeneous networks of the model exhibit a critical threshold consists of critical activity rate and infection rate in the spreading dynamic. The critical threshold of infection rate is increased by node activity, and node activity also shows a critical phenomenon given certain infection rate. Results validate that our model is a feasible and economical method to control spreading dynamics and promote further application of innovation diffusion, viral marketing in reality.

In the region of parameters where the homogeneous solution gets spontaneously destabilized, perturbations grow along the unstable directions made available across the networks of connections, yielding irregular spatio-temporal patterns. We exploit the spectral properties of the Laplacian operator associated to the graph in order to modify its topology, while preserving the unstable manifold of the underlying equilibrium. The new network is isodynamic to the former, meaning that it reproduces the dynamical response (pattern) to a perturbation, as displayed by the original system. The first method acts directly on the eigenmodes, thus resulting in a general redistribution of link weights which, in some cases, can completely change the structure of the original network. The second method uses localization properties of the eigenvectors to identify and randomize a subnetwork that is mostly embedded only into the stable manifold. We test both techniques on different network topologies using the Ginzburg-Landau system as a reference model. Whereas the correlation between patterns on isodynamic networks generated via the first recipe is larger, the second method allows for a finer control at the level of single nodes. This work opens up a new perspective on the multiple possibilities for identifying the family of discrete supports that instigate equivalent dynamical responses on a multispecies reaction-diffusion system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000448950500078	30385860	J	Menolascino, Delsin; Ching, ShiNung								Information spectra and optimal background states for dynamical networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						16181	10.1038/s41598-018-34528-y					NOV 1 2018	2018	We consider the notion of stimulus representation over dynamic networks, wherein the network states encode information about the identify of an afferent input (i.e. stimulus). Our goal is to understand how the structure and temporal dynamics of networks support information processing. In particular, we conduct a theoretical study to reveal how the background or 'default' state of a network with linear dynamics allows it to best promote discrimination over a continuum of stimuli. Our principal contribution is the derivation of a matrix whose spectrum (eigenvalues) quantify the extent to which the state of a network encodes its inputs. This measure, based on the notion of a Fisher linear discriminant, is relativistic in the sense that it provides an information value quantifying the 'knowablility' of an input based on its projection onto the background state. We subsequently optimize the background state and highlight its relationship to underlying state noise covariance. This result demonstrates how the best idle state of a network may be informed by its structure and dynamics. Further, we relate the proposed information spectrum to the controllabilty gramian matrix, establishing a link between fundamental control-theoretic network analysis and information processing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000448950500033	30385795	J	Laszka, Aron; Johnson, Benjamin; Grossklags, Jens								On the Assessment of Systematic Risk in Networked Systems								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET TECHNOLOGY				18	4					48	10.1145/3166069					NOV 2018	2018	In a networked system, the risk of security compromises depends not only on each node's security but also on the topological structure formed by the connected individuals, businesses, and computer systems. Research in network security has been exploring this phenomenon for a long time, with a variety of modeling frameworks predicting how many nodes we should expect to lose, on average, for a given network topology, after certain types of incidents. Meanwhile, the pricing of insurance contracts for risks related to information technology (better known as cyber-insurance) requires determining additional information, for example, the maximum number of nodes we should expect to lose within a 99.5% confidence interval. Previous modeling research in network security has not addressed these types of questions, while research on cyber-insurance pricing for networked systems has not taken into account the network's topology. Our goal is to bridge that gap, by providing a mathematical basis for the assessment of systematic risk in networked systems.We define a loss-number distribution to be a probability distribution on the total number of compromised nodes within a network following the occurrence of a given incident, and we provide a number of modeling results that aim to be useful for cyber-insurers in this context. We prove NP-hardness for the general case of computing the loss-number distribution for an arbitrary network topology but obtain simplified computable formulas for the special cases of star topologies, ER-random topologies, and uniform topologies. We also provide a simulation algorithm that approximates the loss-number distribution for an arbitrary network topology and that appears to converge efficiently for many common classes of topologies.Scale-free network topologies have a degree distribution that follows a power law and are commonly found in real-world networks. We provide an example of a scale-free network in which a cyber-insurance pricing mechanism that relies naively on incidence reporting data will fail to accurately predict the true risk level of the entire system. We offer an alternative mechanism that yields an accurate forecast by taking into account the network topology, thus highlighting the lack/importance of topological data in security incident reporting. Our results constitute important steps toward the understanding of systematic risk and help to contribute to the emergence of a viable cyber-insurance market.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1533-5399	1557-6051		WOS:000457135300009		J	Tanaka-Ishii, Kumiko; Kobayashi, Tatsuru								Taylor's law for linguistic sequences and random walk models								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS				2	11					UNSP 115024	10.1088/2399-6528/aaefb2					NOV 2018	2018	Taylor's law describes the fluctuation characteristics underlying a complex system in which the variance of an event within a time span grows by a power law with respect to the mean. Although Taylor's law has been applied in many natural and social systems, its application for language has been scarce. This article describes a new, natural way to apply Taylor analysis to texts. The method was applied to over 1100 texts across 14 languages and showed how the Taylor exponents of natural language written texts were consistently around 0.58, thus being universal. The exponents were also evaluated for other language-related data, such as speech corpora (0.63 for adult speech, 0.68 for child-directed speech), programming language sources (0.79), and music (0.79). The results show how the Taylor exponent serves to quantify the fundamental structural complexity underlying linguistic time series. To explain the nature of natural language sequences possessing such different degrees of fluctuation, we investigated various mathematical models that could produce a Taylor exponent similar to that of real data. While the majority of previous probabilistic sequential models could not produce a Taylor exponent larger than 0.50, the same as in the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) case, random walk sequences on complex networks could produce fluctuation. We show that among various possibilities, random walks on a Barabasi-Albert (BA) graph with small mean degree could fulfill the scaling properties of Zipf's law and the long-range correlation, in addition to having a Taylor's law exponent larger than 0.5, thus giving a new perspective to reconsider the nature of language.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2399-6528			WOS:000456498500028		J	Juhasz, Sandor; Lengyel, Balazs								Creation and persistence of ties in cluster knowledge networks								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY				18	6			1203	1226		10.1093/jeg/lbx039					NOV 2018	2018	Knowledge networks are important to understand learning in industry clusters but surprisingly little is known about what drives the formation, persistence and dissolution of ties. Applying stochastic actor-oriented models on longitudinal relational data from a mature cluster in a medium-tech industry, we show that triadic closure and geographical proximity increase the probability of tie creation but does not influence tie persistence. Cognitive proximity is positively correlated to tie persistence but firms create ties to cognitively proximate firms only if they are loosely connected through common third partners. We propose a micro-perspective to understand how endogenous network effects, cognitive proximity of actors and their interplay influence the evolutionary process of network formation in clusters.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1468-2702	1468-2710		WOS:000456585500001		J	Yang, Yang; Liu, Yuan; Fan, Ming								Online inter-provincial trade in China								INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND E-BUSINESS MANAGEMENT				16	4	SI		831	842		10.1007/s10257-017-0348-9					NOV 2018	2018	There is a large disparity in terms of per capital e-commerce consumption between more developed east coastal provinces and less developed inner provinces in China, which reflects the disparities in economic development and income between these regions. E-commerce could integrate China's domestic economy as it facilitates cross-region flow of goods, strengthens regional linkage, and becomes the channel through which economic growth in one region spills over to other regions. On the other hand, e-commerce could also make regions more divergent. With a reduced trading cost, regions with comparative advantages in certain industries could have even wider and farther reaches and enjoy increasing returns. In this study, we specifically examine the pattern of e-commerce activities in China over time. We find that the production and sales of agricultural and clothing products have become more concentrated over time. The trade pattern as measured by trade flows among different provinces is mixed. While the pattern is slightly more concentrated in B2C platform, the pattern is more diversified for C2C market. Our regression analysis indicates that GDPs in origin provinces positively affect the trade flows, but distances impede trade, consistent with the gravity model. Interestingly, GDPs of the destination provinces are not significant.

Random walk on the activity-driven model with mutual selection								EPL				124	4					48004	10.1209/0295-5075/124/48004					NOV 2018	2018	Random walks are one of the most fundamental types of stochastic processes and have been applied in various domains, such as ranking systems and searching. In this paper, we investigate random walk process unfolding on a generalized version of the activity-driven modelling framework by considering mutual agreement. The model is characterized by a linking function that describes the probability of the existence of an edge, which depends mutually on the fitness of the vertices on both ends of that edge. We investigate two typical forms of linking functions and derive analytically exact expressions for the asymptotic behavior of random walks and the mean first-passage time for the two cases, respectively. We find that, compared with the activity-driven network model, mutual agreement has nontrivial effects on the properties of random walk processes. For the first case, when the fitness of the ends of a link is independent, we find that the capability of vertices to gather walkers is not only related to the vertices' activity, but also determined by their propensity of receiving connections. For the second case, when the creation of the link is determined by whether the sum of the two end points' fitness is larger than a threshold, we find that for vertices with activity larger than a given threshold, the stronger the activity is, the more walkers they will collect in the stationary state. Finally, we confirm our analytical prediction via large-scale numerical simulations performed by controlling flexible parameters. The results presented here contribute to the understanding of the evolution mechanism of the mutual selection network model and give us an insight into their effects on random walks processes.

Many methods, ranging from the optimization-based algorithms to the heuristic-based algorithms, have been proposed for solving such a problem. Due to the inherent complexity of identifying network structure, how to design an effective algorithm with a higher accuracy and a lower computational cost still remains an open problem. Inspired by the computational capability and positive feedback mechanism in the wake of foraging process of Physarum, a kind of slime, a general Physarum-based computational framework for community detection is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed framework, the inter-community edges can be identified from the intra-community edges in a network and the positive feedback of solving process in an algorithm can be further enhanced, which are used to improve the efficiency of original optimization-based and heuristic-based community detection algorithms, respectively. Some typical algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization algorithm, and Markov clustering algorithm) and real-world datasets have been used to estimate the efficiency of our proposed computational framework. Experiments show that the algorithms optimized by Physarum-inspired computational framework perform better than the original ones, in terms of accuracy and computational cost.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1545-5963	1557-9964		WOS:000453563100018	27992347	J	Lou-Magnuson, Matthew; Onnis, Luca								Social Network Limits Language Complexity								COGNITIVE SCIENCE				42	8			2790	2817		10.1111/cogs.12683					NOV 2018	2018	Natural languages vary widely in the degree to which they make use of nested compositional structure in their grammars. It has long been noted by linguists that the languages historically spoken in small communities develop much deeper levels of compositional embedding than those spoken by larger groups. Recently, this observation has been confirmed by a robust statistical analysis of the World Atlas of Language Structures. In order to examine this connection mechanistically, we propose an agent-based model that accounts for key cultural evolutionary features of language transfer and language change. We identify transitivity as a physical parameter of social networks critical for the evolution of compositional structure and the hierarchical patterning of scale-free distributions as inhibitory.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0364-0213	1551-6709		WOS:000453527500013	30264473	J	Sagar, Vikram; Zhao, Yi; Sen, Abhijit					Sagar, Vikram/0000-0002-3402-0662			Effect of time varying transmission rates on the coupled dynamics of epidemic and awareness over a multiplex network								CHAOS				28	11					113125	10.1063/1.5042575					NOV 2018	2018	A non-linear stochastic model is presented to study the effect of time variation of transmission rates on the co-evolution of epidemics and its corresponding awareness over a two layered multiplex network. In the model, the infection transmission rate of a given node in the epidemic layer depends upon its awareness probability in the awareness layer. Similarly, the infection information transmission rate of a node in the awareness layer depends upon its infection probability in the epidemic layer. The spread of disease resulting from physical contacts is described in terms of a Susceptible Infected Susceptible process over the epidemic layer and the spread of information about the disease outbreak is described in terms of an Unaware Aware Unaware process over the virtual interaction mediated awareness layer. The time variation of the transmission rates and the resulting co-evolution of these mutually competing processes are studied in terms of a network topology dependent parameter (alpha). Using a second order linear theory, it is shown that in the continuous time limit, the co-evolution of these processes can be described in terms of damped and driven harmonic oscillator equations. From the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation, it is shown that for a suitable choice of the parameter (alpha), the two processes can either exhibit sustained oscillatory or damped dynamics. The damped dynamics corresponds to the endemic state. Furthermore, for the case of an endemic state, it is shown that the inclusion of the awareness layer significantly lowers the disease transmission rate and reduces the size of the epidemic. The infection probability of the nodes in the endemic state is found to have a dependence on both the transmission rates and on their absolute degrees in each of the network layers and on the relative differences between their degrees in the respective layers.

Unlike reproducibility and generalizability issues, RSS is relatively underexplored. Yet, understanding it is imperative for better analytical outcome. In breast cancer, RSS correlates strongly with enrichment for proliferation genes and signature size. Removal of proliferation genes from random signatures reduces the predictive power of random signatures. Almost all genes are correlated to a certain extent with the proliferation signature, making complete elimination of its confounding effects impossible. RSS goes beyond breast cancer, because it also exists in other diseases; it is especially strong in other cancers in a platform-independent manner, and less severe, but present nonetheless, in nonproliferative diseases.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1359-6446	1878-5832		WOS:000452577900004	29864526	J	Kasatkin, Dmitry V.; Nekorkin, Vladimir I.

We found that networks with a random sparse structure of connections predominantly demonstrate the scenario as a result of which chimera states are formed. The formation of chimera states retains the features of the hierarchical organization observed in networks with global connections [D.V. Kasatkin, S. Yanchuk, E. Scholl, V.I. Nekorkin, Phys. Rev. E 96, 062211 (2017)], and also demonstrates a number of new properties due to the presence of a random structure of network topology. In this case, the formation of coherent groups takes a much longer time interval, and the sets of elements that form these groups can be significantly rearranged during the evolution of the network. We also found chimera states, in which along with the coherent and incoherent groups, there are subsets, whose different elements can be synchronized with each other for sufficiently long periods of time.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1951-6355	1951-6401		WOS:000452764600006		J	Deng, Chao; Song, Jinwei; Sun, Ruizhi; Cai, Saihua; Shi, Yinxue								Gridwave: a grid-based clustering algorithm for market transaction data based on spatial-temporal density-waves and synchronization								MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS				77	22			29623	29637		10.1007/s11042-017-5441-z					NOV 2018	2018	The notion of density has been widely used in many spatial-temporal (ST) clustering methods. This paper proposes the novel notion of an ST density-wave, which is an extension of the notion of density. It also presents a new grid-based ST clustering algorithm called Gridwave based on the notion of ST density-waves and ST synchronization. The proposed algorithm can be used to discover synchronized changes in density among various locations as well as distinguish ST events and noise from market transaction data. Based on the theory of small-world networks, our algorithm can be used to evaluate ST synchronized correlations among regions with respective to the ST density over the whole network. To improve its performance, the proposed algorithm was implemented using parallel computing. To verify its feasibility, a real large-scale market transaction dataset was used to demonstrate the ST synchronized correlations and the final clustering results. Although our algorithm is applied in a domain-specific case, we suggest that the clustering notion and method could be generalized for other domain applications with similar ST data.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1380-7501	1573-7721		WOS:000451780800024		J	Dai, Meifeng; Zong, Yue; He, Jiaojiao; Sun, Yu; Shen, Chunyu; Su, Weiyi								The trapping problem of the weighted scale-free treelike networks for two kinds of biased walks								CHAOS				28	11					113115	10.1063/1.5045829					NOV 2018	2018	It has been recently reported that trapping problem can characterize various dynamical processes taking place on complex networks. However, most works focused on the case of binary networks, and dynamical processes on weighted networks are poorly understood. In this paper, we study two kinds of biased walks including standard weight-dependent walk and mixed weight-dependent walk on the weighted scale-free treelike networks with a trap at the central node. Mixed weight-dependent walk including non-nearest neighbor jump appears in many real situations, but related studies are much less. By the construction of studied networks in this paper, we determine all the eigenvalues of the fundamental matrix for two kinds of biased walks and show that the largest eigenvalue has an identical dominant scaling as that of the average trapping time (ATT). Thus, we can obtain the leading scaling of ATT by a more convenient method and avoid the tedious calculation. The obtained results show that the weight factor has a significant effect on the ATT, and the smaller the value of the weight factor, the more efficient the trapping process is. Comparing the standard weight-dependent walk with mixed weight-dependent walk, although next-nearest-neighbor jumps have no main effect on the trapping process, they can modify the coefficient of the dominant term for the ATT.

The most general way to describe population structures are graphs. An important observable on evolutionary graphs is the probability that a novel mutation spreads through the entire population. But what drives this spread of a mutation towards fixation? Here, we propose a novel way to understand the forces driving fixation by borrowing techniques from evolutionary demography to quantify the invasion fitness and the effective population size for different graphs. Our method is very general and even applies to weighted graphs with node dependent fitness. However, we focus on analytical results for undirected graphs with node independent fitness. The method will allow to conceptually integrate evolutionary graph theory with theoretical genetics of structured populations.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1553-7358			WOS:000451835900028	30419017	J	Desmarchelier, Benoit; Zhang, Linjia				zhang, linjia/R-1373-2019	zhang, linjia/0000-0002-4675-6511			Innovation networks and cluster dynamics								ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE				61	3	SI		553	578		10.1007/s00168-018-0882-5					NOV 2018	2018	Contributions in terms of clusters life cycle indicate that intense interactions between a variety of agents within a cluster are essential to its success. Despite being accepted by the literature, to our knowledge, this view has not yet been confirmed by analyses of large temporal networks of interactions within industrial clusters. The paper proposes to fill this gap and to show that network analysis can explain clusters success, failure, and transition from one phase of the life cycle to another. In this perspective, we build and study the innovation networks of three clusters over a 10-year period. We find that clusters' growth is all but smooth and that low assortativity and preferential attachment among agents can constitute safeguards against clusters decline. These observations support contributions advocating for non-deterministic life cycles in which clusters can still grow, even after a period of pronounced decline.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0570-1864	1432-0592		WOS:000452762400007		J	Maslennikov, Oleg V.; Nekorkin, Vladimir I.

It is shown that increasing coupling strength gives rise to hierarchical processes of oscillation quenching. In case of frequency-degree correlated networks, higher-frequency oscillators gradually become almost quenched while low-frequency ones still remain oscillating. In case of amplitude-degree correlated networks, there appear three distinct domains, two contain low-amplitude oscillations with positive and negative means, and the third includes high-amplitude oscillations around the origin.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1951-6355	1951-6401		WOS:000452764600018		J	Kong, Yunchuan; Yu, Tianwei								A graph-embedded deep feedforward network for disease outcome classification and feature selection using gene expression data								BIOINFORMATICS				34	21			3727	3737		10.1093/bioinformatics/bty429					NOV 1 2018	2018	Motivation: Gene expression data represents a unique challenge in predictive model building, because of the small number of samples (n) compared with the huge amount of features (p). This 'n << p' property has hampered application of deep learning techniques for disease outcome classification. Sparse learning by incorporating external gene network information could be a potential solution to this issue. Still, the problem is very challenging because (i) there are tens of thousands of features and only hundreds of training samples, (ii) the scale-free structure of the gene network is unfriendly to the setup of convolutional neural networks.Results: To address these issues and build a robust classification model, we propose the Graph-Embedded Deep Feedforward Networks (GEDFN), to integrate external relational information of features into the deep neural network architecture. The method is able to achieve sparse connection between network layers to prevent overfitting. To validate the method's capability, we conducted both simulation experiments and real data analysis using a breast invasive carcinoma RNA-seq dataset and a kidney renal clear cell carcinoma RNA-seq dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The resulting high classification accuracy and easily interpretable feature selection results suggest the method is a useful addition to the current graph-guided classification models and feature selection procedures.									4	0	0	3	0	4			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000450038900017	29850911	J	Kulkarni, Prakash; Uversky, Vladimir N.

The latter comprises proteins not amenable to experimental structure determination by existing means and inaccessible to homology modeling. Hence, the dark proteome has remained largely unappreciated. Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that lack rigid 3D structure are a major component of this dark proteome across all three kingdoms of life. Despite lack of structure, IDPs play critical roles in numerous important biological processes. Furthermore, IDPs serve as crucial constituents of proteinaceous membrane-less organelles (PMLOs), where they often serve as drivers and controllers of biological liquid-liquid phase transitions responsible for the PMLO biogenesis. In this perspective, the role of IDPs is discussed in i) the origin of prebiotic life and the evolution of the first independent primordial living unit akin to Tibor Ganti's chemoton, which preceded the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA), ii) role in multicellularity and hence, in major evolutionary transitions, and iii), their role in phenotypic switching, and the emergence of new traits and adaptive opportunities via non-genetic, protein-based mechanisms. The emerging picture suggests that despite being major constituents of the dark matter, IDPs may be the dark horse in the protein universe.									3	0	0	1	0	3			1615-9853	1615-9861		WOS:000450407800007	30218496	J	Zhang, Chengjun; Liu, Jin; Qu, Yanzhen; Han, Tianqi; Ge, Xujun; Zeng, An								Enhancing the robustness of recommender systems against spammers								PLOS ONE				13	11					e0206458	10.1371/journal.pone.0206458					NOV 1 2018	2018	The accuracy and diversity of recommendation algorithms have always been the research hotspot of recommender systems. A good recommender system should not only have high accuracy and diversity, but also have adequate robustness against spammer attacks. However, the issue of recommendation robustness has received relatively little attention in the literature. In this paper, we systematically study the influences of different spammer behaviors on the recommendation results in various recommendation algorithms. We further propose an improved algorithm by incorporating the inner-similarity of user's purchased items in the classic KNN approach. The new algorithm effectively enhances the robustness against spammer attacks and thus outperforms traditional algorithms in recommendation accuracy and diversity when spammers exist in the online commercial systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000449027600051	30383766	J	Sabarathinam, S.; Prasad, Awadhesh								Generalized synchronization in a conservative and nearly conservative systems of star network								CHAOS				28	11					113107	10.1063/1.5030730					NOV 2018	2018	We report the coexistence of synchronized and unsynchronized states in a mutually coupled star network of nearly conservative non-identical oscillators. Generalized synchronization is observed between the central oscillator with the peripherals, and phase synchronization is found among the peripherals in weakly dissipative systems. However, the basin size of the synchronization region decreases as dissipation strength is increased. We have demonstrated these phenomena with the help of Duffing and Lorenz84 oscillators with conservative, nearly conservative, and dissipative properties.

In particular, a statistical-mechanics-based neural network model is expected to allow one to interpret many aspects of the neural firing and learning processes in terms of general concepts and mechanisms in statistical physics. Nevertheless, the definition of the free energy in a neural system is usually an intricate problem without an evident solution. After the pioneering work by Hopfield, several statistical-mechanics-based models have suggested a variety of definition of the free energy or the entropy in a neural system. Among those, the Feynman machine, proposed recently, presents the free energy of a neural system defined via the Feynman path integral formulation with the explicit time variable. In this study, we first give a brief review of the previous relevant models, paying attention to the troublesome problems in them, and examine how the Feynman machine overcomes several vulnerable points in previous models and derives the outcome of the firing or the learning rule in a (biological) neural system as the extremum state in the free energy. Specifically, the model reveals that the biological learning mechanism, called spike-timing-dependent plasticity, relates to the free-energy minimization principle. Basically, computing and learning mechanisms in the Feynman machine base on the exact spike timings of neurons, such as those in a biological neural system. We discuss the consequence of the adoption of an explicit time variable in modeling a neural system and the application of the free-energy minimization principle to understanding the phenomena in the brain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000451308800040		J	Berliant, Marcus; Watanabe, Axel H.

There is extensive research on the subject, where each city is treated symmetrically in terms of the cost of transactions with other cities. Recent developments in network theory facilitate the examination of an asymmetric transport network. In a scale-free network, the chance of observing extremes in network connections becomes higher than the Gaussian distribution predicts and, therefore, it explains the emergence of large clusters. The city-size distribution shares the same pattern. This paper decodes how accessibility of a city to other cities on the transportation network can boost its local economy and explains the city-size distribution as a result of its underlying transportation network structure. We confirm our model predictions with US and Belgian data.

In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Automata model of the Dopamine System, based on the mathematical model proposed by Gutkin et al. Our model allows different kinds of addiction causes to be described. In particular, we consider the problem of Internet addiction and its spread through interaction on social networks. This study is undertaken by performing simulations of virtual social networks by varying the network topology and the interaction propensity of users. We show that scale-free networks favour the emergence of addiction phenomena, in particular when users having a high propensity to interaction are present. We propose also variants of our model in which the propensity of a user to interact in a social network may vary over time, either caused by social imitation or by "social sitting".

Many such networks publicly release structural information, with all personal information removed. Empirical studies have shown, however, that this provides a false sense of privacy-it is possible to identify almost all users that appear in two such anonymized network as long as a few initial mappings are known. We analyze this problem theoretically by reconciling two versions of an artificial power-law network arising from independent subsampling of vertices and edges. We present a new algorithm that identifies most vertices and makes no wrong identifications with high probability. The number of vertices matched is shown to be asymptotically optimal. For an n-vertex graph, our algorithm uses seed nodes (for an arbitrarily small ) and runs in quasilinear time. This improves previous theoretical results which need seed nodes and have runtimes of order . Additionally, the applicability of our algorithm is studied experimentally on different networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0178-4617	1432-0541		WOS:000440976300018		J	Lu, Dianjie; Huang, Xiaoxia; Zhang, Guijuan; Zheng, Xiangwei; Liu, Hong					lu, dianjie/0000-0001-5435-5307			Trusted Device-to-Device Based Heterogeneous Cellular Networks: A New Framework for Connectivity Optimization								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY				67	11			11219	11233		10.1109/TVT.2018.2870872					NOV 2018	2018	Device-to-device-based heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs) have received considerable attention recently. However, connectivity optimization is a challenging problem for the existing network architecture that remains open in the literature because it is affected by many uncertain real-life factors, such as locations of femtocell base stations (FemtoBSs), the trust relationships among user equipments (UEs), and the dynamic characteristics of spectrum. In this paper, we propose a connectivity optimization method that jointly considers the influence of these factors. In this method, we first build a new framework called the trusted device-to-device-based HCN to capture the stochastic characteristics of the above factors through three models: the dynamic FemtoBS employment architecture, the trust-based directed graph model, and the dynamic spectrum graph model. Based on this framework, we then formulate the connectivity optimization problem as the maximization of the average number of connected UEs in a given time by selecting the optimal FemtoBSs. Since the maximization problem is proven to he NP-hard, we propose three heuristic algorithms, namely, the simple greedy algorithm, the submodular greedy algorithm, and the particle swarm optimization based FemtoBSs selection algorithm to obtain the suboptimal solutions. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is justified through extensive simulations with differently parameterized factors.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0018-9545	1939-9359		WOS:000449962900085		J	Khan, Jebran; Lee, Sungchang					Khan, Jebran/0000-0002-9971-1149			Online Social Networks (OSN) Evolution Model Based on Homophily and Preferential Attachment								SYMMETRY-BASEL				10	11					654	10.3390/sym10110654					NOV 2018	2018	In this paper, we propose a new scale-free social networks (SNs) evolution model that is based on homophily combined with preferential attachments. Our model enables the SN researchers to generate SN synthetic data for the evaluation of multi-facet SN models that are dependent on users' attributes and similarities. Homophily is one of the key factors for interactive relationship formation in SN. The synthetic graph generated by our model is scale-invariant and has symmetric relationships. The model is dynamic and sustainable to changes in input parameters, such as number of nodes and nodes' attributes, by conserving its structural properties. Simulation and evaluation of models for large-scale SN applications need large datasets. One way to get SN data is to generate synthetic data by using SN evolution models. Various SN evolution models are proposed to approximate the real-life SN graphs in previous research. These models are based on SN structural properties such as preferential attachment. The data generated by these models is suitable to evaluate SN models that are structure dependent but not suitable to evaluate models which depend on the SN users' attributes and similarities. In our proposed model, users' attributes and similarities are utilized to synthesize SN graphs. We evaluated the resultant synthetic graph by analyzing its structural properties. In addition, we validated our model by comparing its measures with the publicly available real-life SN datasets and previous SN evolution models. Simulation results show our resultant graph to be a close representation of real-life SN graphs with users' attributes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-8994			WOS:000451165100121		J	Calabrese, Armando; Capece, Guendalina; Costa, Roberta; Di Pillo, Francesca; Giuffrida, Stefania					DI PILLO, FRANCESCA/0000-0002-6423-0070; Giuffrida, Stefania/0000-0003-1693-8610			A 'power law' based method to reduce size-related bias in indicators of knowledge performance: An application to university research assessment								JOURNAL OF INFORMETRICS				12	4			1263	1281		10.1016/j.joi.2018.10.005					NOV 2018	2018	The knowledge production provided by universities is essential to sustaining a country's long-term economic growth and international competitiveness. Many nations are thus driving to create sustainable and effective funding environments. The evaluation of university knowledge, productivity and research quality becomes critical, with ever increasing share of public funding allocated on the basis of research assessment exercises. Nevertheless, the existing methods to assess the universities' knowledge production are often affected by limits and biases, extensively discussed in the scientific literature.In this paper we study how to reduce the effect of size-related bias due to university size on the indicators of knowledge performance used in evaluation exercises. We propose an innovative utilization of the scale-free property of the power laws as a scaling relationship, to normalize research productivity indicators, and provide results independent by the university size. Our method has evident policy implications and gives a contribution for the future design of assessment exercises. We apply our findings in a recent Italian research assessment exercise.

By applying the Lyapunov stability theory and the stochastic analysis method, a sufficient condition for state estimation is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Based on the bisection method, we propose an algorithm to obtain the maximally allowable packet loss probability for state estimation. If the real packet loss probability is smaller than the maximally allowable value, the state estimation problem is feasible. Finally, it is demonstrated by simulation that the proposed scheme is feasible and effective.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000448935400053		J	Bongini, Marco; Rigutini, Leonardo; Trentin, Edmondo								Recursive Neural Networks for Density Estimation Over Generalized Random Graphs								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS				29	11			5441	5458		10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2803523					NOV 2018	2018	Structured data in the form of labeled graphs (with variable order and topology) may be thought of as the outcomes of a random graph (RG) generating process characterized by an underlying probabilistic law. This paper formalizes the notions of generalized RG (GRG) and probability density function (pdf) for GRGs. Thence, a "universal" learning machine (combining the encoding module of a recursive neural network and a radial basis functions' network) is introduced for estimating the unknown pdf from an unsupervised sample of GRGs. A maximum likelihood training algorithm is presented and constrained so as to ensure that the resulting model satisfies the axioms of probability. Techniques for preventing the model from degenerate solutions are proposed, as well as variants of the algorithm suitable to the tasks of graphs classification and graphs clustering. The major properties of the machine are discussed. The approach is validated empirically through experimental investigations in the estimation of pdfs for synthetic and real-life GRGs, in the classification of images from the Caltech Benchmark data set and molecules from the Mutagenesis data set, and in clustering of images from the LabelMe data set.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2162-237X	2162-2388		WOS:000447832200022	29993614	J	Liu, Quan; Wang, Yanbo; Yuan, Bo								Matrix Factorization From a Few Dominators								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS				29	11			5749	5755		10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2795581					NOV 2018	2018	The Pareto principle states that most effects are the result of a few dominating causes. This principle also fits most matrix completion problems. In practice, most real-world data sets exhibit nonuniformly distributed observations. Unfortunately, most existing algorithms are designed based on uniformly distributed observations. In this brief, we propose a matrix factorization approach to recover a large-scale matrix from a dominating submatrix that is composed of a few most important rows and columns from the original matrix. The method for evaluating the importance of a row or column is inspired by the term frequency-inverse document frequency in natural language processing. The selected submatrix is recovered using an existing base matrix factorization algorithm. Then, factors of the completed submatrix are used to retrieve the factors of the whole matrix via a linear regression model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for recovering the matrix from nonuniformly distributed observations. In addition, our framework is naturally applicable for parallel and distributed computing, which is very encouraging for massive-sized data sets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2162-237X	2162-2388		WOS:000447832200046	29994376	J	Jin, Hai; Wang, Na; Yu, Dongxiao; Hua, Qiang-Sheng; Shi, Xuanhua; Xie, Xia								Core Maintenance in Dynamic Graphs: A Parallel Approach Based on Matching								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS				29	11			2416	2428		10.1109/TPDS.2018.2835441					NOV 2018	2018	The core number of vertices is a basic index depicting cohesiveness of a graph, and has been widely used in large-scale graph analytics. In this paper, we study the update of core numbers of vertices in dynamic graphs with edge insertions/deletions, which is known as the core maintenance problem. Different from previous approaches that just focus on the case of single-edge insertion/deletion and sequentially handle the edges when multiple edges are inserted/deleted, we investigate the parallelism in the core maintenance procedure. Specifically, we show that if the inserted/deleted edges constitute a matching, the core number update with respect to each inserted/deleted edge can be handled in parallel. Based on this key observation, we propose parallel algorithms for core maintenance in both cases of edge insertions and deletions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the efficiency, stability, parallelism and scalability of our algorithms on different types of real-world, synthetic graphs and temporal networks. Comparing with former approaches, our algorithms can improve the core maintenance efficiency significantly.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1045-9219	1558-2183		WOS:000447046200002		J	Kuga, Kazuki; Tanimoto, Jun								Impact of imperfect vaccination and defense against contagion on vaccination behavior in complex networks								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										113402	10.1088/1742-5468/aae84f					NOV 2018	2018	We explore a mathematical framework of the vaccination game taking into account spatial structure, say, and degree distribution amid individuals. The framework presumes SIR/V dynamics in a season, which is followed by a strategy update process that estimates whether an individual will take a protecting measure, considering imperfect vaccination or defense against contagion. The numerical result based on multi-agent simulations (MAS) validates our theory, suggesting that a more heterogeneous spatial structure is vulnerable to an epidemic. This conclusion is consistent with the qualitative knowledge that a pandemic arises more easily in a scale-free network than in homogeneous networks because of the negative contribution of hub agents acting as super spreaders.Highlights- A new theoretical model is established for the vaccination game with a SIR/V model and either imperfect vaccination or intermediate measures.- The model considers degree distribution amid individuals, which significantly influences disease spreading.- The model is validated by simulation results.- The results prove that a more heterogeneous network is disadvantageous to prevent disease spreading.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1742-5468			WOS:000450213900002		J	Tabakhi, Atena M.; Yeoh, William; Tourani, Reza; Natividad, Francisco; Misra, Satyajayant								Communication-Sensitive Pseudo-Tree Heuristics for DCOP Algorithms								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS				27	7	SI				1860008	10.1142/S0218213018600084					NOV 2018	2018	Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem (DCOP) is a powerful paradigm to model multi-agent systems through enabling multiple agents to coordinate with each other to solve a problem. These agents are often assumed to be cooperative, that is, they communicate with other agents in order to optimize a global objective. However, the communication times between all pairs of agents are assumed to be identical in the evaluation of most DCOP algorithms. This assumption is impractical in almost all real-world applications. In this paper, we study the impact of empirically evaluating a DCOP algorithm under the assumption that communication times between pairs of agents can vary. In addition, we evaluate a DCOP algorithm using ns-2, a discrete-event simulator that is widely used in the computer networking community, to simulate the communication times, as opposed to the standard DCOP simulators that are used to evaluate DCOP algorithms in the AI community. Furthermore, we propose heuristics that exploit the non-uniform communication times to speed up DCOP algorithms that operate on pseudo-trees. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed heuristics improve the runtime of those algorithms up to 20%. These heuristics are evaluated on different benchmarks such as scale-free graphs, random graphs, and an instance of the smart grid, Customer-Driven Microgrid (CDMG) application.					29th Annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)29th Annual IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)	NOV 06-08, 2017NOV 06-08, 2017	IEEE; IEEE Comp SocIEEE; IEEE Comp Soc	Boston, MABoston, MA	0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-2130	1793-6349		WOS:000450114500002		J	Lee, UnCheol; Mashour, George A.

No single brain region or mechanism has been identified as the neural correlate of consciousness, suggesting that consciousness might emerge through complex interactions of spatially and temporally distributed brain functions. The goal of this review article is to introduce the basic concepts of networks and explain why the application of network science to general anesthesia could be a pathway to discover a fundamental mechanism of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness. This article reviews data suggesting that reduced network efficiency, constrained network repertoires, and changes in cortical dynamics create inhospitable conditions for information processing and transfer, which lead to unconsciousness. This review proposes that network science is not just a useful tool but a necessary theoretical framework and method to uncover common principles of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0003-3022	1528-1175		WOS:000447499000027	29683806	J	Smith, Edward Bishop; Rand, William					Rand, William/0000-0002-8294-1757			Simulating Macro-Level Effects from Micro-Level Observations								MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				64	11			5405	5421		10.1287/mnsc.2017.2877					NOV 2018	2018	We consider the fruits of integrating agent-based modeling (ABM) with lab-based experimental research with human subjects. While both ABM and lab experiments have similar aims-to identify the rules, tendencies, and heuristics by which individual agents make decisions and respond to external stimuli-they work toward their common goal in notably different ways. Behavioral-lab research typically exposes human subjects to experimental manipulations, or treatments, to make causal inferences by observing variation in response to the treatment. ABM researchers ascribe individual simulated "agents" with decision rules describing their behavior and subsequently attempt to replicate "macro" level empirical patterns. Integration of ABM and lab experiments presents advantages for both sets of researchers. ABM researchers will benefit from exposure to a larger set of empirically validated mechanisms that can add nuance and refinement to their models of human behavior and system dynamics. Lab-oriented researchers will gain from ABM a method for assessing the validity and magnitude of their findings, adjudicating between competing mechanisms, developing new theory to test in the lab, and exploring macro-level, long-run implications of subtle, micro-level observations that can be difficult to observe in the field. We offer an example of this mixed-method approach related to status, social networks, and job search and issue guidance for future research attempting such integration.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0025-1909	1526-5501		WOS:000449627200023		J	Iosifidis, George; Charette, Yanick; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Littera, Giuseppe; Tassiulas, Leandros; Christakis, Nicholas A.

Here, we study Sardex, a fast-growing community currency in Sardinia (involving 1,477 businesses arrayed in a network with 48,170 transactions) using network analysis to shed light on its operation. Based on our experience with its day-to-day operations, we propose performance metrics tailored for Sardex but also to similar economic systems, introduce criteria for identifying prominent economic actors and investigate the interplay between network structure and economic robustness. Leveraging new methods for quantifying network 'cyclic density' and 'k-cycle centrality,' we show that geodesic transaction cycles, where money flows in a circle through the network, are prevalent and that certain nodes have a pivotal role in them. We analyse the transactions within cycles and find that the economic turnover of the involved firms is higher, and that excessive currency and debt accumulations are lower. We also measure a similar, but secondary, effect for nodes and edges that serve as intermediaries to many transactions. These metrics are strong indicators of the success of such mutual credit systems at individual and collective levels.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2397-3374			WOS:000449539900013		J	Bloem-Reddy, Benjamin; Orbanz, Peter								Random-walk models of network formation and sequential Monte Carlo methods for graphs								JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY				80	5			871	898		10.1111/rssb.12289					NOV 2018	2018	We introduce a class of generative network models that insert edges by connecting the starting and terminal vertices of a random walk on the network graph. Within the taxonomy of statistical network models, this class is distinguished by permitting the location of a new edge to depend explicitly on the structure of the graph, but being nonetheless statistically and computationally tractable. In the limit of infinite walk length, the model converges to an extension of the preferential attachment modelin this sense, it can be motivated alternatively by asking what preferential attachment is an approximation to. Theoretical properties, including the limiting degree sequence, are studied analytically. If the entire history of the graph is observed, parameters can be estimated by maximum likelihood. If only the final graph is available, its history can be imputed by using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We develop a class of sequential Monte Carlo algorithms that are more generally applicable to sequential network models and may be of interest in their own right. The model parameters can be recovered from a single graph generated by the model. Applications to data clarify the role of the random-walk length as a length scale of interactions within the graph.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1369-7412	1467-9868		WOS:000448897700002		J	Wang, Zhiqiang; Liang, Jiye; Li, Ru								A fusion probability matrix factorization framework for link prediction								KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS				159				72	85		10.1016/j.knosys.2018.06.005					NOV 1 2018	2018	Link prediction is a fundamental research problem in network data analysis. Networks usually contain rich node to-node topological metrics and their effective use is crucial to solve the link prediction problem. Despite significant advances, the existing metric-based link prediction methods usually only consider one single topological metric and thus show some limitations in different types of networks; the existing matrix factorization-based models mainly focus on modeling the adjacent matrix of a network, and this is hard to ensure the modeling of those topological metrics that can play an important role in link prediction. This study develops effective approaches by fusing the adjacent matrix and some key topological metrics in a unified probability matrix factorization framework. In these approaches, we consider not only the symmetric metrics but also the asymmetric metrics which are usually not taken into consideration in the related work. In our probability matrix factorization framework, we first present two fusion models by fusing two kinds of metrics respectively, and based on the fusion models, we put forward the final fusion models which fuse the two kinds of metrics simultaneously. To verify the performance of all the fusion models, we conduct the experiments with six directed networks and six undirected ones, and the extensive experiments show that the proposed models provide impressive predicting performance for link prediction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0950-7051	1872-7409		WOS:000446145600006		J	Moreno, Sebastian; Pfeiffer, Joseph J., III; Neville, Jennifer								Scalable and exact sampling method for probabilistic generative graph models								DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY				32	6			1561	1596		10.1007/s10618-018-0566-x					NOV 2018	2018	Interest in modeling complex networks has fueled the development of multiple probabilistic generative graph models (PGGMs). PGGMs are statistical methods that model the network distribution and match common characteristics of real world networks. Recently, scalable sampling algorithms for well known PGGMs, made the analysis of large-scale, sparse networks feasible for the first time. However, it has been demonstrated that these scalable sampling algorithms do not sample from the original underlying distribution, and sometimes produce very unlikely graphs. To address this, we extend the algorithm proposed in Moreno et al.(in: IEEE 14th international conference on data mining, pp 440-449, 2014) for a single model and develop a general solution for a broad class of PGGMs. Our approach exploits the fact that PGGMs are typically parameterized by a small set of unique probability valuesthis enables fast generation via independent sampling of groups of edges with the same probability value. By sampling within groups, we remove bias due to conditional sampling and probability reallocation. We show that our grouped sampling methods are both provably correct and efficient. Our new algorithm reduces time complexity by avoiding the expensive rejection sampling step previously necessary, and we demonstrate its generality, by outlining implementations for six different PGGMs. We conduct theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation to demonstrate the strengths of our algorithms. We conclude by sampling a network with over a billion edges in 95s on a single processor.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1384-5810	1573-756X		WOS:000444383000002		J	Miranda, Gisele H.

The literature on graphs and networks have contributed to the structural characterization of shapes with different theoretical approaches. We performed a study on the relationship between the shape architecture and the network topology constructed over the shape boundary. For that, we used a method for network modeling proposed in 2009. Firstly, together with curvature analysis, we evaluated the proposed approach for regular polygons. This way, it was possible to investigate how the network measurements vary according to some specific shape properties. Secondly, we evaluated the performance of the proposed shape descriptor in classification tasks for three datasets, accounting for both real-world and synthetic shapes. We demonstrated that not only degree related measurements are capable of distinguishing classes of objects. Yet, when using measurements that account for distinct properties of the network structure, the construction of the shape descriptor becomes more computationally efficient. Given the fact the network is dynamically constructed, the number of iterations can be reduced. The proposed approach accounts for a more robust set of structural measurements, that improved the discriminant power of the shape descriptors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Firstly, a generalized model with weakly-protected and strongly-protected susceptible nodes is developed by considering the possibility of an intruded node converting back to a weakly-protected susceptible one. The dynamics of the generalized compartmental model is intensively discussed and analyzed, deriving several sufficient conditions for its global stability. Following this work, a novel node-based model is newly proposed to describe malware propagation over an arbitrary connected network including synthesized and real networks. From a microscopic perspective, we establish the novel model by introducing several different variables for each node which describe the probabilities of a node locating at respective states. Our theoretical analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the propagating network is a key factor determining malware prevalence. Specifically, the range of the leading eigenvalue can be split into three subintervals in which malware approaches extinction very quickly, or tends to extinction, or persists, depending on into which subinterval the largest eigenvalue of the propagating network falls. Theoretically, the trivial equilibrium of our new node-based model is clearly proved to be exponentially globally stable when the maximum eigenvalue is less than a threshold. We also illustrate the predictive effectiveness of our model by designing some numerical simulations on some regular and scale-free networks. Consequently, we conclude that malware prevalence can be effectively prevented by properly adjusting the spreading network, e.g., reducing the number of nodes and deleting some edges, so that its maximum eigenvalue falls into the appropriate subinterval.

We study both undirected and directed graphs. Our results allow us to derive computable expressions for non-backtracking versions of network centrality measures based on the matrix exponential. We find that eliminating backtracking walks in this context does not significantly increase the computational expense. We show how the new measures may be interpreted in terms of standard exponential centrality computation on a certain multilayer network. Insights from this block matrix interpretation also allow us to characterize centrality measures arising from general matrix functions. Rigorous analysis on the star graph illustrates the effect of non-backtracking and shows that localization can be eliminated when we restrict to non-backtracking walks. We also investigate the localization issue on synthetic networks. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The goal of these algorithms is to identify high-quality items such as reliable news, credible information sources, and important discoveries-in short, high-quality content should rank at the top. Prior work has shown that choosing what is popular may amplify random fluctuations and lead to sub-optimal rankings. Nonetheless, it is often assumed that recommending what is popular will help high-quality content "bubble up" in practice. Here we identify the conditions in which popularity may be a viable proxy for quality content by studying a simple model of a cultural market endowed with an intrinsic notion of quality. A parameter representing the cognitive cost of exploration controls the trade-off between quality and popularity. Below and above a critical exploration cost, popularity bias is more likely to hinder quality. But we find a narrow intermediate regime of user attention where an optimal balance exists: choosing what is popular can help promote high-quality items to the top. These findings clarify the effects of algorithmic popularity bias on quality outcomes, and may inform the design of more principled mechanisms for techno-social cultural markets.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000448589200027	30374134	J	Qiao, Lishan; Zhang, Limei; Chen, Songcan; Shen, Dinggang								Data-driven graph construction and graph learning: A review								NEUROCOMPUTING				312				336	351		10.1016/j.neucom.2018.05.084					OCT 27 2018	2018	A graph is one of important mathematical tools to describe ubiquitous relations. In the classical graph theory and some applications, graphs are generally provided in advance, or can at least be defined clearly. Thus, the main focus is to measure/analyze the graphs for mining informative patterns. However, for many real-world scenarios, the graph is often uncertain due to the fact that data associated with the vertices in the graph are high-dimensional, noisy, differently distributed, and even no clear definition. As a result, one needs to design or learn graphs from data prior to any analysis, which in turn affects the subsequent tasks. Therefore, constructing a high-quality graph has become an increasingly hot research problem, which inspired many graph construction methods being proposed in the past years. Since there has been no systematic summary on this topic, in this paper, we review the main-stream graph construction/learning methods involved in both general machine learning algorithms (including semi-supervised learning, clustering, manifold learning, and spectral kernel learning, etc.) and some specific applications (especially, the modeling and analysis of functional brain connectivity). Additionally, we introduce a matrix-regularized graph learning framework that can benefit to unify some existing graph construction models and develop new graph learning algorithms. Finally, we discuss several related topics and some promising research directions in this field. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Spatial public goods game (PGG) serves as a baseline model when investigating the evolution of cooperation in collective interactions. Since analyzing collective interactions and dynamics in spatial structures is very complicated, a full theoretical understanding of spatial PGGs is still deficient. Here we generalize spatial PGGs in a three-layer weighted network-investment, benefit allocation, and strategy dispersal layers-which are not necessarily identical and thus cover a wide class of population structures and interaction scenarios. We provide an analytic formula that accurately predicts when cooperation is favored over defection, and that is applicable in populations of any size under weak selection. We prove that in regular networks investment and benefit allocation are essentially symmetric-that exchanging structures of investment and benefit allocation layers does not affect the evolutionary dynamics at all. The success of cooperators relies heavily on the correlation between an individual's investment in a game and its benefit allocated from the same game. In most cases, the positive correlation, i.e., a greater investment in games with a larger share of benefits, facilitates a cooperative society. Importantly, we also show that diversifying the amounts of investment in different games or benefit allocation to different participants, if implementing improperly, might impede the global cooperation.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1367-2630			WOS:000448168200001		J	Aparicio, David; Ribeiro, Pedro; Silva, Fernando				Silva, Fernando/C-5986-2009; Ribeiro, Pedro/F-9537-2011	Silva, Fernando/0000-0001-8411-7094; Ribeiro, Pedro/0000-0002-5768-1383; Aparicio, David/0000-0001-8250-041X			Graphlet-orbit Transitions (GoT): A fingerprint for temporal network comparison								PLOS ONE				13	10					e0205497	10.1371/journal.pone.0205497					OCT 18 2018	2018	Given a set of temporal networks, from different domains and with different sizes, how can we compare them? Can we identify evolutionary patterns that are both (i) characteristic and (ii) meaningful? We address these challenges by introducing a novel temporal and topological network fingerprint named Graphlet-orbit Transitions (GoT). We demonstrate that GoT provides very rich and interpretable network characterizations. Our work puts forward an extension of graphlets and uses the notion of orbits to encapsulate the roles of nodes in each subgraph. We build a transition matrix that keeps track of the temporal trajectory of nodes in terms of their orbits, therefore describing their evolution. We also introduce a metric (OTA) to compare two networks when considering these matrices. Our experiments show that networks representing similar systems have characteristic orbit transitions. GoT correctly groups synthetic networks pertaining to well-known graph models more accurately than competing static and dynamic state-of-the-art approaches by over 30%. Furthermore, our tests on real-world networks show that GoT produces highly interpretable results, which we use to provide insight into characteristic orbit transitions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000447701300037	30335791	J	Liu, Yezheng; Li, Lingfei; Wang, Hai; Sun, Chunhua; Chen, Xiayu; He, Jianmin; Jiang, Yuanchun								The Competition of Homophily and Popularity in Growing and Evolving Social Networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						15431	10.1038/s41598-018-33409-8					OCT 18 2018	2018	Previous studies have used several models to investigate the mechanisms for growing and evolving real social networks.

It is shown by our network performance simulation that this network has many merits such as free-scale, fewer connections, larger clustering coefficient, and smaller average shortest path length in comparison to the passive optical network. The novel network structure can replace the far-end service connections with the near-end ones, reduce congestions in an optical network, and, furthermore, relieve traffic burden in optical backbone and metropolitan area networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1477			WOS:000447788300001		J	Li, Bo; Liu, Xiao; Wang, Wen-Juan; Zhao, Feng; An, Zhi-Yong; Zhao, Hai								Metanetwork Transmission Model for Predicting a Malaria-Control Strategy								FRONTIERS IN GENETICS				9						446	10.3389/fgene.2018.00446					OCT 17 2018	2018	Background: Mosquitoes are the primary vectors responsible for malaria transmission to humans, with numerous experiments having been conducted to aid in the control of malaria transmission. One of the main approaches aims to develop malaria parasite resistance within the mosquito population by introducing a resistance (R) allele. However, when considering this approach, some critical factors, such as the life of the mosquito, female mosquito fertility capacity, and human and mosquito mobility, have not been considered. Thus, an understanding of how mosquitoes and humans affect disease dynamics is needed to better inform malaria control policymaking.Methods: In this study, a method was proposed to create a metanetwork on the basis of the geographic maps of Gambia, and a model was constructed to simulate evolution within a mixed population, with factors such as birth, death, reproduction, biting, infection, incubation, recovery, and transmission between populations considered in the network metrics. First, the same number of refractory mosquitoes (RR genotype) was introduced into each population, and the prevalence of the R allele (the ratio of resistant alleles to all alleles) and malaria were examined. In addition, a series of simulations were performed to evaluate two different deployment strategies for the reduction of the prevalence of malaria. The R allele and malaria prevalence were calculated for both the strategies, with 10,000 refractory mosquitoes deployed into randomly selected populations or selection based on nodes with top-betweenness values. The 10,000 mosquitoes were deployed among 1, 5, 10, 20, or 40 populations.Results: The simulations in this paper showed that a higher RR genotype (resistant-resistant genes) ratio leads to a higher R allele prevalence and lowers malaria prevalence. Considering the cost of deployment, the simulation was performed with 10,000 refractory mosquitoes deployed among 1 or 5 populations, but this approach did not reduce the original malaria prevalence. Thus, instead, the 10,000 refractory mosquitoes were distributed among 10, 20, or 40 populations and were shown to effectively reduce the original malaria prevalence. Thus, deployment among a relatively small fraction of central nodes can offer an effective strategy to reduce malaria.Conclusion: The standard network centrality measure is suitable for planning the deployment of refractory mosquitoes.Importance: Malaria is an infectious disease that is caused by a plasmodial parasite, and some control strategies have focused on genetically modifying the mosquitoes. This work aims to create a model that takes into account mosquito development and malaria transmission among the population and how these factors influence disease dynamics so as to better inform malaria- control policymaking.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000447499200001	30386373	J	Hiraoka, Takayuki; Jo, Hang-Hyun				Jo, Hang-Hyun/F-4666-2012; Hiraoka, Takayuki/R-4294-2018	Jo, Hang-Hyun/0000-0002-4214-9204; Hiraoka, Takayuki/0000-0001-7016-8560			Correlated bursts in temporal networks slow down spreading								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						15321	10.1038/s41598-018-33700-8					OCT 17 2018	2018	Spreading dynamics has been considered to take place in temporal networks, where temporal interaction patterns between nodes show non-Poissonian bursty nature. The effects of inhomogeneous interevent times (IETs) on the spreading have been extensively studied in recent years, yet little is known about the effects of correlations between IETs on the spreading. In order to investigate those effects, we study two-step deterministic susceptible-infected (SI) and probabilistic SI dynamics when the interaction patterns are modeled by inhomogeneous and correlated IETs, i.e., correlated bursts. By analyzing the transmission time statistics in a single-link setup and by simulating the spreading in Bethe lattices and random graphs, we conclude that the positive correlation between IETs slows down the spreading. We also argue that the shortest transmission time from one infected node to its susceptible neighbors can successfully explain our numerical results.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000447511100028	30333572	J	Kim, Jae In; Chang, Hyunjoon; Lee, Myeongsang; Na, Sungsoo								Internal interaction changes within the mutation of SLC26A4 STAS domain								CHEMICAL PHYSICS LETTERS				710				226	233		10.1016/j.cplett.2018.09.002					OCT 16 2018	2018	Pendrin (SLC26A4) is a protein associated with the auditory system. Pendred syndrome (PDS) and DFNB4 are typical auditory disorders caused by mutations in the SLC26A4 STAS domain. We generated an SLC26A4 STAS domain model and six mutated STAS domain models related to PDS, DFNB4, and PDS/DFNB4 by homology modeling. Molecular dynamics simulation was performed to find the equilibration conformation and fluctuation information. Using fluctuation information, we calculated betweenness centrality and edge betweenness to reveal communication between secondary structures of STAS domain.

The weight of a node is B-i(theta), where B-i is the betweenness of the node. We assume that the two networks A and B of size N-A and N-B are BA networks, and suppose two different one-to-one interdependent network, one is random, the other based on nodes' betweenness. Assume that a failed node in network A leads to a redistribution of the flow passing through it to its neighboring nodes and the interdependent node in network B also to be disabled, where the two failure factors happen concurrently, or successively. We find that the one-to-one random interdependent weighted complex network reaches the strongest robustness level when the weight parameter theta=0.5, no matter cascading failure caused by two failure factors happen concurrently, or successively. And when the interdependent relationship based on nodes' betweenness, theta=0.7 to get the strongest robustness level.

Secondly, we analyze the solutions from initial loads and types of failed nodes resulted by our algorithm.

However, it is more practical to explore how to improve team's creative performance from the perspective of network and community structure. We conduct a survey of a real scientific team network, in which each team member chooses five members (s)he regards as his (her) friends, five members (s)he always works with, and five members (s)he wants to work with. The members were asked to rank the five members they selected according to their closeness. We derived three networks: a friend network, a real cooperation network and a desired cooperation network. Additionally, we have constructed a directed-weighted network with the team members as nodes, the relations (friend, real cooperation, and cooperation desire) between members as edges, and the closeness of these relations as weights. The main results show the following. (1) This scientific team is a leader network with nodes with weighted degrees significantly larger than those of other nodes. The weighted in-degree sequence and the weighted out degree sequence have different properties. (2) Creative performance is higher for the leader communities than for the self-organized communities. After removing the leader nodes of the leader communities, creative performance in the communities and in the whole network decreased. (3) Quadratic assignment procedure correlation (QAP) analysis shows that the similarity between the real cooperation network and the desired cooperation network is lowest in self-organized communities, and the creative performance is low if the similarity between the two networks is low; (4) creative performance is lower in a network that only takes into account the desired cooperation of members. This study sheds light on the potential application of complex networks in the issues of group division and team construction in the workplace and in the field of education. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Taking into account the real topological relations among the participants and the psychological characteristics of the users, in this paper, a hotspot propagation model based on heterogeneous mean field and evolutionary games is proposed. First, in real social networks, the changes of hotspot's trend could lead to the dynamic changes of users' willingness to participate in the hot topic. This effect is reflected in the dynamic behaviors among the users. In this work, based on the evolutionary games, a dynamic evolution mechanism for users' willingness to participate in hotspot is constructed and dynamically adjusts the infection rate of information dissemination model. Second, in view of the heterogeneity of the real network structure and the complexity of the heterogeneous mean field, graphical evolutionary game is introduced to improve the heterogeneous mean field. Thus, a new dynamics model of information dissemination is constructed based on graphical evolutionary game. Finally, considering the dynamic behavior among the nodes and the heterogeneity of real social networks, we obtain a hotspot propagation model based on dynamic evolution mechanism and improved heterogeneous mean field. To verify the proposed model, we perform simulations over synthetic networks and real network. Experiments show that the model effectively reveal the impact of different driving factors on information dissemination, and predict the trend of information dissemination in social networks.

However, there are currently no computational models and methods available for directly constructing such multiple GRNs that not only share some common hub genes but also possess tissue/condition-specific regulatory edges.Results: In this paper, we proposed a new graphic Gaussian model for joint reconstruction of multiple gene regulatory networks (JRmGRN), which highlighted hub genes, using gene expression data from several tissues/conditions. Under the framework of Gaussian graphical model, JRmGRN method constructs the GRNs through maximizing a penalized log likelihood function. We formulated it as a convex optimization problem, and then solved it with an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm. The performance of JRmGRN was first evaluated with synthetic data and the results showed that JRmGRN outperformed several other methods for reconstruction of GRNs. We also applied our method to real Arabidopsis thaliana RNA-seq data from two light regime conditions in comparison with other methods, and both common hub genes and some conditions-specific hub genes were identified with higher accuracy and precision.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000448782100007	29718177	J	Costa, Raquel L.; Boroni, Mariana; Soares, Marcelo A.

The main goal of this study was to identify distinct co-expression patterns between HPV+ and HPV- HNSCC and to provide insights into potential regulatory mechanisms/effects within the analyzed networks. We selected cases deposited in The Cancer Genome Atlas database comprising data of gene expression, methylation profiles and mutational patterns, in addition to clinical information. The intersection among differentially expressed and differentially methylated genes showed the negative correlations between the levels of methylation and expression, suggesting that these genes have their expression levels regulated by methylation alteration patterns in their promoter. Weighted correlation network analysis was used to identify co-expression modules and a systematic approach was applied to refine them and identify key regulatory elements integrating results from the other omics. Three distinct co-expression modules were associated with HPV status and molecular signatures. Validation using independent studies reporting biological experimental data converged for the most significant genes in all modules. This study provides insights into complex genetic and epigenetic particularities in the development and progression of HNSCC according to HPV status, and contribute to unveiling specific genes/pathways as novel therapeutic targets in HNSCC.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000447318500009	30323202	J	Abdelkader, A.; Elshorbagy, A.; Tuninetti, M.; Laio, F.; Ridolfi, L.; Fahmy, H.; Hoekstra, A.

The framework has two components: (1) a national water model that simulates agricultural, industrial and municipal water uses, and available water and land resources; and (2) an international virtual water trade model that captures national virtual water exports and imports related to trade in crops and animal products. This National Water, Food & Trade (NWFT) modeling framework is applied to Egypt, a water-poor country and the world's largest importer of wheat. Egypt's food and water gaps and the country's food (virtual water) imports are estimated over a baseline period (1986-2013) and projected up to 2050 based on four scenarios. Egypt's food and water gaps are growing rapidly as a result of steep population growth and limited water resources. The NWFT modeling framework shows the nexus of the population dynamics, water uses for different sectors, and their compounding effects on Egypt's food gap and water self-sufficiency. The sensitivity analysis reveals that for solving Egypt's water and food problem non-water-based solutions like educational, health, and awareness programs aimed at lowering population growth will be an essential addition to the traditional water resources development solution. Both the national and the global models project similar trends of Egypt's food gap. The NWFT modeling framework can be easily adapted to other nations and regions. (c) 2018 The Authors.

Understanding the interplay of rich content and social relationships is potentially valuable to the fundamental network mining task, i.e. the link prediction. Although some of the link prediction methods have been proposed by combining topological and non-topological information simultaneously, the in-depth analysis of the rich content still being in a minority, and the rich content in the social-information networks is still underused in solving link prediction. In this paper, we approach the link prediction problem in social-information network by combining network structure and topic information which is extracted from users' rich content. We first define a kind of user-to-user topic inclusion degree (TID) based on the dissemination mechanism of the published content in the social-information networks, and then construct a TID-based sparse network. On the basis, we build a fusion probabilistic matrix factorization model which solves the link prediction problem by fusing the information of the original following/followed network and the TID-based network in a unified probabilistic matrix factorization framework. We conduct link prediction experiments on two types of real social-information network datasets, i.e. Twitter and Weibo. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective in solving the link prediction problem in social-information networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The general detectors traditionally utilize the spectral characteristics of whole networks to decide whether the anomalous networks exist or not. Moreover, many algorithms model the background networks with special random graphs, such as Erdos-Renyi random graphs. However, these methods may not achieve good detection performance because the spectral information of anomalous networks extracting from the relational data of the whole networks is subtle. Furthermore, the assumptions of the models limit the applications of the methods. In order to improve the detection capability of algorithms and relax the restriction of the background networks models, we develop two preprocessing approaches, referred to as subgraph search and vertex classification, and propose two detection algorithms, which can be applicable to the generalized network model (Chung-Lu random graph). By leveraging statistic features of priori data, the subgraph search method can obtain local network nodes that are more anomalous than the remainder. Moreover, the vertex classification is used to further distinguish the anomalous nodes from the local ones. And then, by using the relational data corresponding to the local nodes, the detection statistics are constructed to detect the anomalous network. Additionally, based on concentration of measure theory, the probability bounds of performance analysis are derived for the presented algorithms. Simulation examples are provided to illustrate that the proposed detectors can achieve better detection performance than the existing algorithms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1053-587X	1941-0476		WOS:000444825200004		J	Hala, D.; Cullen, J.

This study integrates a transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) model of steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions with a flux balance analysis (FBA) model of steroidogenesis. The two models were functionally related. Output from the TRN model (as magnitude gene expression simulated using extreme pathway (ExPa) analysis) was used to re-constrain linear inequality bounds for reactions in the FBA model. This allowed TRN model predictions to impact the steroidogenesis FBA model. These two interrelated models were tested as follows: First, in silico targeted steroidogenic enzyme gene activations in the TRN model showed high co-regulation (67-83%) for genes involved with oocyte growth and development (cyptlal, cyp17-17,20-Iyase, 3 beta-HSD and cyp19a1a). Whereas, no or low co-regulation corresponded with genes concertedly involved with oocyte final maturation prior to spawning (cyp17-17 alpha-hydroxylase (0%) and 20 beta-HSD (33%)). Analysis (using FBA) of accompanying steroidogenesis fluxes showed high overlap for enzymes involved with oocyte growth and development versus those involved with final maturation and spawning. Second, the TRN model was parameterized with in vivo changes in the presence/absence of transcription factors (TFs) during oogenesis in female fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Oogenesis stages studied included: PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature, Mature-Ovulated and Ovulated-Atretic stages. Predictions of TRN genes active during oogenesis showed overall elevated expressions for most genes during early oocyte development (PreVitellogenic-Vitellogenic, Vitellogenic-Mature) and post-ovulation (Ovulated-Atretic). Whereas ovulation (Mature-Ovulated) showed highest expression for cyp17-17a-hydroxylase only. FBA showed steroid hormone productions to also follow trends concomitant with steroidogenic enzyme gene expressions. General trends predicted by in silicomodeling were similar to those observed in vivo. The integrated computational framework presented was capable of mechanistically representing aspects of reproductive function in fish. This approach can be extended to study reproductive effects under exposure to adverse environmental or anthropogenic stressors. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A large number of methods have been developed for this problem, among which the label propagation algorithm (LPA) has attracted much attention because of its advantages of nearly-linear running time and easy implementation. Nevertheless, the random updating order and tie-breaking strategy in LPA make the algorithm unstable and may even lead to the formation of a monster community. In this paper, an improved LPA called LPA-INTIM is proposed for solving the community detection problem. Firstly, an intimacy matrix is constructed using local topology information for measuring the intimacy between nodes. And then, the node importance is calculated to ensure that nodes are updated in a specific order. Finally, the label influence is evaluated for updating node label during the label propagation process. In addition, we introduce a novel tightness function to improve the stability of the proposed algorithm. By the comparison with the methods presented in the literatures, experimental results on real-world and synthetic networks show the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000446821300006		J	Cao, Zhenfeng; He, Zhou; Johnson, Neil F.								Impact on the topology of power-law networks from anisotropic and localized access to information								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	4					042307	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.042307					OCT 9 2018	2018	Preferential attachment is a popular candidate mechanism for generating power-law networks. However, incoming nodes require global information about existing nodes' connectivities before connecting, whereas such information access within real-world networks may be only anisotropic and localized. Here we investigate how anisotropic and localized information access affect the resulting network topology. We find that anisotropy impacts the power-law exponent significantly but has only a weak influence on the clustering coefficient. By contrast, we find that locality influences the clustering coefficient significantly but has only weak influence on the power-law exponent. We show that this generalized network-generation mechanism is capable of generating networks with a broad range of power-law exponents and clustering coefficients.

The need to compensate for the scarcity of data, while optimally employing the available information, has led to the birth of a research field known as network reconstruction. Since the latter has benefited from the contribution of researchers working in disciplines as different as mathematics, physics and economics, the results achieved so far are still scattered across heterogeneous publications. Most importantly, a systematic comparison of the network reconstruction methods proposed up to now is currently missing. This review aims at providing a unifying framework to present all these studies, mainly focusing on their application to economic and financial networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

When one considers a short epidemic on a slowly growing network, such as the spread of a strain of influenza in a population for one season, it is reasonable to assume that the degree-correlated network is static during the course of an epidemic. In this case using only information about the network degree distribution is not enough to capture the exponential growth phase, the epidemic peak or the final epidemic size. Hence, in this paper we formulate an edge-based SIR epidemic model on degree-correlated networks, which includes the Miller model on configuration networks as a special case. The model is relatively low-dimensional; in particular, considering the fact that it captures degree correlations. Moreover, we derive rate equations to compute two node degree correlations in a growing network. Predictions of our model agree well with the corresponding stochastic SIR process on degree-correlated networks, such as the exponential growth phase, the epidemic peak and the final epidemic size. The basic reproduction number R-0 and the final epidemic size are theoretically derived, which are equivalent to those based on the percolation theory. However, our model has the advantage that it can trace the dynamic spread of an epidemic on degree-correlated networks. This provides us with more accurate information to predict and control the spread of diseases in growing populations with biased-mixing. Finally, our model is tested on degree-correlated networks with clustering, and it is shown that our model is robust to degree-correlated networks with small clustering. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

K-truss decomposition is an algorithm for identifying the most influential nodes in the network. We find that K-truss decomposition only considers edge clustering characteristics, without considering the diffusion characteristics, so it is easily affected by the local clustering structure in the network, such as core-like groups. There are mutually closely connected the core-like groups in the network, but the correlation between the core-like groups and the other parts of the network is less, so the information is easy to spread in the core-like groups, but not in the other parts of the network, nor over the whole network. For the reason, we propose an index to measure the edge diffusion characteristics in a network, and it is found that the diffusion characteristics of some edges in the periphery of the network are relatively high, but the clustering characteristics of these edges are relatively low, so they are not beneficial for rapid information propagation. In this paper, by considering the relationship between the clustering characteristics and diffusion characteristics of the edges, we propose a novel network structure optimization algorithm for information propagation. By measuring the comprehensive ability strength of the clustering characteristics and the diffusion characteristics of the edges, we can filter out the edges whose comprehensive ability is poor in the network, then determine whether the edges should be optimized according to the relative relationship between the clustering characteristics and the diffusion characteristics of the edges. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, it is carried out to optimize the structures of four real networks, and verify the effective range of information propagation before and after the optimization of network structure from the classical independent cascade model. The results show that the network topology optimized by the proposed algorithm can effectively increase the range of information propagation. Moreover, the number of leaf nodes in the optimized network is reduced, and the clustering coefficient and the average path length are also reduced.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1000-3290			WOS:000448517700006		J	de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz; Rodrigues, Francisco A.; Moreno, Yamir				Moreno, Yamir/A-1076-2009; de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz/G-6465-2012	Moreno, Yamir/0000-0002-0895-1893; de Arruda, Guilherme Ferraz/0000-0003-1647-5126			Fundamentals of spreading processes in single and multilayer complex networks								PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS				756				1	59		10.1016/j.physrep.2018.06.007					OCT 5 2018	2018	Spreading processes have been largely studied in the literature, both analytically and by means of large-scale numerical simulations. These processes mainly include the propagation of diseases, rumors and information on top of a given population. In the last two decades, with the advent of modern network science, we have witnessed significant advances in this field of research. Here we review the main theoretical and numerical methods developed for the study of spreading processes on complex networked systems. Specifically, we formally define epidemic processes on single and multilayer networks and discuss in detail the main methods used to perform numerical simulations. Throughout the review, we classify spreading processes (disease and rumor models) into two classes according to the nature of time: (i) continuous-time and (ii) cellular automata approach, where the second one can be further divided into synchronous and asynchronous updating schemes. Our revision includes the heterogeneous mean-field, the quenched-mean field, and the pair quenched mean field approaches, as well as their respective simulation techniques, emphasizing similarities and differences among the different techniques. The content presented here offers a whole suite of methods to study epidemic-like processes in complex networks, both for researchers without previous experience in the subject and for experts.

The model allows interesting comparisons among the different economies related to the compositions of the national baskets. Synthetic solutions can also be used to estimate hidden and unexploited growth potentials. These prerogatives are strictly connected with the fact that a network structure is at the basis of the model. Such a network expresses the mutual influences of different products through resource transfers, and is a key ingredient producing cooperative growth effects which can be quantified and distinguished from those generated by deterministic drifts and representing direct resource inputs. An analysis of this network, which differs substantially from those previously considered within the economic complexity approach, allows to estimate the centrality of different products in each national basket, highlighting the most essential commodities for each economy. Solutions of the model give the possibility of performing counterfactual analyses aimed at estimating how much the growth of each country could have profited from a general strengthening, or weakening, of the links in the same products network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000448545700016		J	Jiang, Lincheng; Jing, Yumei; Hu, Shengze; Ge, Bin; Xiao, Weidong								Identifying Node Importance in a Complex Network Based on Node Bridging Feature								APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL				8	10					1914	10.3390/app8101914					OCT 2018	2018	Identifying node importance in complex networks is of great significance to improve the network damage resistance and robustness. In the era of big data, the size of the network is huge and the network structure tends to change dynamically over time. Due to the high complexity, the algorithm based on the global information of the network is not suitable for the analysis of large-scale networks. Taking into account the bridging feature of nodes in the local network, this paper proposes a simple and efficient ranking algorithm to identify node importance in complex networks. In the algorithm, if there are more numbers of node pairs whose shortest paths pass through the target node and there are less numbers of shortest paths in its neighborhood, the bridging function of the node between its neighborhood nodes is more obvious, and its ranking score is also higher. The algorithm takes only local information of the target nodes, thereby greatly improving the efficiency of the algorithm. Experiments performed on real and synthetic networks show that the proposed algorithm is more effective than benchmark algorithms on the evaluation criteria of the maximum connectivity coefficient and the decline rate of network efficiency, no matter in the static or dynamic attack manner. Especially in the initial stage of attack, the advantage is more obvious, which makes the proposed algorithm applicable in the background of limited network attack cost.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2076-3417			WOS:000448653700209		J	Paassen, Benjamin; Goepfert, Christina; Hammer, Barbara					Gopfert, Christina/0000-0003-2517-4907; Paassen, Benjamin/0000-0002-3899-2450			Time Series Prediction for Graphs in Kernel and Dissimilarity Spaces								NEURAL PROCESSING LETTERS				48	2	SI		669	689		10.1007/s11063-017-9684-5					OCT 2018	2018	Graphs are a flexible and general formalism providing rich models in various important domains, such as distributed computing, intelligent tutoring systems or social network analysis. In many cases, such models need to take changes in the graph structure into account, that is, changes in the number of nodes or in the graph connectivity. Predicting such changes within graphs can be expected to yield important insight with respect to the underlying dynamics, e.g. with respect to user behaviour. However, predictive techniques in the past have almost exclusively focused on single edges or nodes. In this contribution, we attempt to predict the future state of a graph as a whole. We propose to phrase time series prediction as a regression problem and apply dissimilarity- or kernel-based regression techniques, such as 1-nearest neighbor, kernel regression and Gaussian process regression, which can be applied to graphs via graph kernels. The output of the regression is a point embedded in a pseudo-Euclidean space, which can be analyzed using subsequent dissimilarity- or kernel-based processing methods. We discuss strategies to speed up Gaussian processes regression from cubic to linear time and evaluate our approach on two well-established theoretical models of graph evolution as well as two real data sets from the domain of intelligent tutoring systems. We find that simple regression methods, such as kernel regression, are sufficient to capture the dynamics in the theoretical models, but that Gaussian process regression significantly improves the prediction error for real-world data.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1370-4621	1573-773X		WOS:000446501500003		J	Said, Anwar; Shah, Syed Waqas Haider; Farooq, Hasan; Mian, Adnan Noor; Imran, Ali; Crowcroft, Jon					Said, Anwar/0000-0002-6715-0068; shah, waqas/0000-0002-4425-9810			Proactive Caching at the Edge Leveraging Influential User Detection in Cellular D2D Networks								FUTURE INTERNET				10	10					93	10.3390/fi10100093					OCT 2018	2018	Caching close to users in a radio access network (RAN) has been identified as a promising method to reduce a backhaul traffic load and minimize latency in 5G and beyond. In this paper, we investigate a novel community detection inspired by a proactive caching scheme for device-to-device (D2D) enabled networks. The proposed scheme builds on the idea that content generated/accessed by influential users is more probable to become popular and thus can be exploited for pro-caching. We use a Clustering Coefficient based Genetic Algorithm (CC-GA) for community detection to discover a group of cellular users present in close vicinity. We then use an Eigenvector Centrality measure to identify the influential users with respect to the community structure, and the content associated to it is then used for pro-active caching using D2D communications. The numerical results show that, compared to reactive caching, where historically popular content is cached, depending on cache size, load and number of requests, up to 30% more users can be satisfied using a proposed scheme while achieving significant reduction in backhaul traffic load.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1999-5903			WOS:000448548300002		J	Chai, Wei Koong					Chai, Wei Koong/0000-0002-4847-5465			Modelling Spreading Process Induced by Agent Mobility in Complex Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				5	4			336	349		10.1109/TNSE.2017.2764523					OCT-DEC 2018	2018	Most conventional epidemic models assume contact-based contagion process. We depart from this assumption and study epidemic spreading process in networks caused by agents acting as carrier of infection. These agents traverse from origins to destinations following specific paths in a network and in the process, infecting the sites they travel across. We focus our work on the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) epidemic model and use continuous-time Markov chain analysis to model the impact of such agent mobility induced contagion mechanics by taking into account the state transitions of each node individually, as oppose to most conventional epidemic approaches which usually consider the mean aggregated behavior of all nodes. Our approach makes one mean field approximation to reduce complexity from exponential to polynomial. We study both network-wide properties such as epidemic threshold as well as individual node vulnerability under such agent assisted infection spreading process. Furthermore, we provide a first order approximation on the agents' vulnerability since infection is bi-directional. We compare our analysis of spreading process induced by agent mobility against contact-based epidemic model via a case study on London Underground network, the second busiest metro system in Europe, with real dataset recording commuters' activities in the system. We highlight the key differences in the spreading patterns between the contact-based versus agent assisted spreading models. Specifically, we show that our model predicts greater spreading radius than conventional contact-based models due to agents' movements. Another interesting finding is that, in contrast to contact-based model where nodes located more centrally in a network are proportionally more prone to infection, our model shows no such strict correlation as in our model, nodes may not be highly susceptible even located at the heart of the network and vice versa.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2327-4697			WOS:000451960400007		J	Bonato, Anthony; del Rio-Chanona, Rita M.; MacRury, Calum; Nicolaidis, Jake; Perez-Gimenez, Xavier; Pralat, Pawel; Ternovsky, Kirill					Perez-Gimenez, Xavier/0000-0002-7969-1136			The robot crawler graph process								DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS				247				23	36		10.1016/j.dam.2018.01.018					OCT 1 2018	2018	Information gathering by crawlers on the web is of practical interest.

In our model, a crawler visits nodes via a deterministic walk determined by their weightings which change during the process deterministically. The minimum, maximum, and average time for the robot crawler to visit all the nodes of a graph is considered on various graph classes such as trees, multi-partite graphs, binomial random graphs, and graphs generated by the preferential attachment model.

It is shown that the removal of a single shortcut link may destroy either completely or partially the network synchronization. Interestingly, when the network is partially desynchronized, it is found that the oscillators can be organized into different groups, with oscillators within each group being highly synchronized but are not for oscillators from different groups, showing the intriguing phenomenon of cluster synchronization. The experimental results are analyzed by the method of eigenvalue analysis, which implies that the formation of cluster synchronization is crucially dependent on the network symmetries. Our study demonstrates the observability of cluster synchronization in realistic systems, and indicates the feasibility of controlling network synchronization by adjusting network topology.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2095-0462			WOS:000433430700005		J	Li, Tingting; Ye, Qianqian; Xi, Lifeng								MARKOV SPECTRA OF SELF-SIMILAR NETWORKS BY SUBSTITUTION RULE								FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY				26	5					1850064	10.1142/S0218348X18500640					OCT 2018	2018	For a class of self-similar networks generated by substitution rules, we investigate them in terms of normalized Laplacian spectra.

In isolated habitats such as inselbergs little is yet known about the temporal dynamics in the availability of floral resources and interacting bee. In the present study, the objective is to verify the effect of seasonality on the bee-plant interaction in an Atlantic Forest inselberg in southeastern Brazil. The bees were sampled monthly in the dry (April/2008-September/2008) and wet seasons (October/2008-March/2009) using an entomological net. A total of 322 bees of 33 species were captured on flowers of 34 species of plants during the year. Bees richness was similar between seasons (22 species in the wet season and 21 in the dry season), but abundance was higher in the wet season (60% of individuals) and higher diversity occurred in the dry season. Augochloropsis sp1 were the most abundant species and visited the largest number of plant species at each season. In the interaction network, plants with the highest degree were distinct between the seasons. The number of possible interactions was higher in the dry season compared to the wet season and connectance was similar; nestedness however varied between the seasons. The composition of plant and bees species was distinct between the seasons, as well as the interactions between them, mainly due to the alteration in the composition of the plant species and the change in the choice of the bees for the floral resources between the seasons.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0361-6525			WOS:000450550200009		J	Wang, Jianwei; He, Jialu; Chen, Wei; Xu, Bo								Abnormal dynamics of cascading edge failures with congestion effect								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	10					1850095	10.1142/S012918311850095X					OCT 2018	2018	Considering congestion effects in realistic network environments, we give a new method to adjust dynamically adjust the weight of the congested edge. We calculate the load on an edge based on the revised betweenness method and propose a novel model with three states of edges to investigate the dynamics of cascading failures in the ring network, the BA scale-free network, and the real traffic networks in London. By two robust metrics, we surprisingly observe the abnormal dynamics of cascading propagation, especially compared with that in the unadjustable weight, the curves of cascading dynamics in the adjustable weight are more irregular, which means that enhancing the capacity of each edge is not always better to avoid the cascading propagation. In addition, our simulation results show that the dynamical change of the edge's weight makes the heterogeneous BA networks more vulnerable.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000450115700004		J	Qin, Zhida; Gan, Xiaoying; Fu, Luoyi; Di, Xin; Tian, Jun; Wang, Xinbing								Content Delivery in Cache-Enabled Wireless Evolving Social Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS				17	10			6749	6761		10.1109/TWC.2018.2863687					OCT 2018	2018	Cache-enabled wireless networks have gained increasing popularity in recent years for facilitating the delivery of content. Most existing works assumed that the network is static without the change of users and content, which is not the case in the real world. In this paper, we study the content delivery in cache-enabled wireless networks, where the network evolves in terms of users and content. We adopt the affiliation network model to reveal the network evolution process, where new users and content are added into the network randomly and connected with existing nodes via the preferential attachment. Users with strong social relations tend to request the same content objects, thus content popularity is sharply concentrated. Therefore, caching technique is more effective. To maximize the content delivery rate, we formulate the optimization problem of caching replication jointly with routing strategy. We show that network evolution can greatly improve the content delivery rate. In particular, when per-user cache capacity is in the order of Theta(1), per-user delivery rate can achieve constant, i.e., the network can scale. Finally, theoretical results are validated based on a real-world data set from Facebook.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1536-1276	1558-2248		WOS:000447047200027		J	Conti, Marco; Passarella, Andrea				Passarella, Andrea/F-3128-2018; Conti, Marco/D-7415-2017	Passarella, Andrea/0000-0002-1694-612X; 			The Internet of People: A human and data-centric paradigm for the Next Generation Internet								COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS				131		SI		51	65		10.1016/j.comcom.2018.07.034					OCT 2018	2018	The cyber-physical convergence, the fast expansion of the Internet at its edge, and tighter interactions between human users and their personal mobile devices push towards a data-centric Internet where the human user becomes more central than ever. We argue that this will profoundly impact primarily on the way data should be handled in the Next Generation Internet. It will require a radical change of the Internet data-management paradigm, from the current platform-centric to a human-centric model. In this paper we present a new paradigm for Internet data management that we name Internet of People (IoP) because it embeds human behavior models in its algorithms. To this end, IoP algorithms exploit quantitative models of the humans' individual and social behavior, from sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics, physics. IoP is not a replacement of the current Internet networking infrastructure, but it exploits legacy Internet services as (reliable) primitives to achieve end-to-end connectivity on a global-scale. In this opinion paper, we first discuss the key features of the IoP paradigm along with the underlying research issues and challenges. Then, we present emerging data-management paradigms that are anticipating IoP. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, the network setting is appreciated to detect the stability and transition of collective behaviors in a network with different connection types. In this paper, the synchronization performance in time-delayed excitable homogeneous random networks (EHRNs) induced by diversity in system parameters is investigated by calculating the synchronization parameter and plotting the spatiotemporal evolution pattern, and distinct impacts induced by parameter-diversity are detected by setting different time delays. It is found that diversity has no distinct effect on the synchronization performance in EHRNs with small time delay being considered. When time delay is increased greatly, the synchronization performance of EHRN degenerates remarkably as diversity is increased. Surprisingly, by setting a moderate time delay, appropriate parameter-diversity can promote the synchronization performance in EHRNs, and can induce the synchronization transition from the asynchronous state to the weak synchronization. Moreover, the bistability phenomenon, which contains the states of asynchronous state and weak synchronization, is observed. Particularly, it is confirmed that the parameter-diversity promoted synchronization performance in time-delayed EHRN is manifested in the enhancement of the synchronization performance of individual oscillation and the increase of the number of synchronization transitions from the asynchronous state to the weak synchronization. Finally, we have revealed that this kind of parameter-diversity promoted synchronization performance is a robust phenomenon.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000448166100002		J	Heinrich, Torsten					Heinrich, Torsten/0000-0001-8873-0806			Network Externalities and Compatibility Among Standards: A Replicator Dynamics and Simulation Analysis								COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				52	3	SI		809	837		10.1007/s10614-017-9706-4					OCT 2018	2018	The importance of network externalities for the development of technology and industry structure has been recognized in evolutionary economic for a long time. However, network externalities are no isolated phenomena. They are based on competing standards in a comprehensive network of technology lines that are based on one another and remain to various degrees interoperable or compatible. As some evidence from the ICT sector inparticular shows, compatibility and tying or bundling of standards may be employed as strategic tools. The present paper investigates the economic role of tied standards for the dynamics of competition between standards. A replicator model operating on an aggregated level is complemented by an agent-based simulation with explicit representation of the network structure among users. A variety of effects are studied, including the role of initial usage share, manipulation of compatibility, expansion of vendors into other segments, as well as the network structure and central or peripheral positioning of agents. The agent-based model contrasts a complete network and a regular ring network with asymmetric network structures derived from Barabasi and Albert's preferential attachment mechanism and triadic closure.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7099	1572-9974		WOS:000445742700005		J	Sarkar, Camellia; Jalan, Sarika								Spectral properties of complex networks								CHAOS				28	10					102101	10.1063/1.5040897					OCT 2018	2018	This review presents an account of the major works done on spectra of adjacency matrices drawn on networks and the basic understanding attained so far.

In this study, firstly we empirically showed the essential evolution characteristics of Renren online social network. The evolution mechanism of online social networks is explained by the perspective of Pareto wealth distribution and bidirectional preferential attachment. Then a novel model is proposed to reproduce the evolution characteristics which are consistent with the ones of Renren online social network, and the evolutionary analytical solution to the proposed model was presented. The results suggest that both Pareto wealth distribution and bidirectional preferential attachment play an important role in the evolution process of online social networks and can help us to understand the evolutionary origin of online social networks. The model has significant implications for dynamic simulation researches of social networks, especially in information diffusion through online communities and infection spreading in real societies.

We used structured questionnaires to collect data for the period January to December 2009 from participants who were involved in the backyard chicken farming network in three avian influenza hotspots (Ratchaburi, Suphan Buri, and Nakhon Pathom provinces) in Thailand. From 557 questionnaires, we identified nodes, points of entry and exit from nodes, and activities relating to backyard chicken farming and movement of chickens, and generated ERGMs based on non-festive periods (Model 1) and the Chinese New Year period (Model 2). In Model 1, k-star (the central node is connected to k other nodes) connections were predominant (P < 0.001). In Model 2, the frequency of movement increased by 10.62 times, k-star connections were still predominant (P < 0.001), and the model was scale-free. Hubs were formed from owners/observers in the arenas/training fields, farmers who raised chickens for consumption only, and traders. In conclusion, our models indicated that, if avian influenza was introduced during non-festive periods, the authorities would need to regularly restrict the movement of chickens. However, during high-frequency periods of movement of backyard chickens, authorities would also need to focus on the network hubs. Our research can be used by the relevant authorities to improve control measures and reduce the risk or lessen the magnitude of disease spread during an avian influenza epidemic.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-5877	1873-1716		WOS:000446147200008	30220398	J	Huang, Changwei; Dai, Qionglin; Li, Haihong								Leaders should be more persistent in evolutionary social dilemmas								EPL				124	1					18001	10.1209/0295-5075/124/18001					OCT 2018	2018	Strategy persistence has been found to play an important role in the emergence and maintenance of cooperation. In this work, we propose a spatial prisoner's dilemma game in which there are two types of individuals, P-individuals with nonzero strategy persistence level and NP-individuals without strategy persistence. We concern with the question: Who should P-individuals be if the goal is to achieve a high level of cooperation? By investigating four different schemes, i.e., uniform, inversely degree-related, degree-related, and collective influence schemes, we find that highly cooperative outcomes emerge if P-individuals are played by leaders with high degrees regardless of the structures of the underlying networks. In contrast, if the masses with low degrees act as P-individuals where leaders change their strategies frequently, cooperation cannot be promoted and, instead, it can even be weakened.

These models allow us to extensively analyse the data obtained from real-world networks, study their relevance and corroborate theoretical results. In this work, we introduce methods, based on degree preserving rewiring, that can be used to tune the clustering and degree-correlations in directed networks with random and scale-free (SF) topologies. They provide null-models to investigate the role of the mentioned properties along with their strengths and limitations. We find that in the case of clustering, structural relationships, that are independent of topology and rewiring schemes are revealed, while in the case of degree-correlations, the network topology is found to play an important role in the working of the mechanisms. We also study the effects of link-density on the efficiency of these rewiring mechanisms and find that in the case of clustering, the topology of the network plays an important role in determining how link-density affects the rewiring process, while in the case of degree-correlations, the link-density and topology, play no role for sufficiently large number of rewiring steps. In both random and SF networks, we study the behaviour of the limiting value of dissortative degree-correlation, as a function of parameters of the networks. Besides the intended purpose of tuning network properties, the proposed mechanisms can also be used as a tool to reveal structural relationships and topological constraints.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000447318800007		J	Wu, Fanyou; Karenlampi, Petri P.								Phase transition in a growing network								JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS				6	5			788	799		10.1093/comnet/cnx058					OCT 2018	2018	We present a probabilistic model for network growth with preferential attachment and self-attractivity. Instead of connecting to a predetermined number of existing nodes, any new node makes a finite number of attempts to connect to previous ones, any trial having a finite probability of success. We find a percolation phase transition which significantly differs from that of related models. Node degree distribution appears scale-free for large degrees, the exponent depending on system connectivity. Cluster size distribution becomes scale-free at the phase transition. Cluster diameter in percolating clusters increases logarithmically with cluster size, but becomes a power-law function at the phase transition. Counted number of boxes becomes exponentially reduced with box size, indicating non-fractal cluster geometry in the connected phase. The geometry however becomes fractal at the phase transition, with power-law exponent 2.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000447318800008		J	Ottaviano, Stefania; De Pellegrini, Francesco; Bonaccorsi, Stefano; Van Mieghem, Piet								Optimal curing policy for epidemic spreading over a community network with heterogeneous population								JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS				6	5			800	829		10.1093/comnet/cnx060					OCT 2018	2018	The design of an efficient curing policy, able to stem an epidemic process at an affordable cost, has to account for the structure of the population contact network supporting the contagious process. Thus, we tackle the problem of allocating recovery resources among the population, at the lowest cost possible to prevent the epidemic from persisting indefinitely in the network. Specifically, we analyse a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic process spreading over a weighted graph, by means of a first-order mean-field approximation. First, we describe the influence of the contact network on the dynamics of the epidemics among a heterogeneous population, that is possibly divided into communities. For the case of a community network, our investigation relies on the graph-theoretical notion of equitable partition; we show that the epidemic threshold, a key measure of the network robustness against epidemic spreading, can be determined using a lower-dimensional dynamical system.Exploiting the computation of the epidemic threshold, we determine a cost-optimal curing policy by solving a convex minimization problem, which possesses a reduced dimension in the case of a community network. Lastly, we consider a two-level optimal curing problem, for which an algorithm is designed with a polynomial time complexity in the network size.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000447318800009		J	Nogueras, Rafael; Cotta, Carlos				Cotta, Carlos/G-2356-2010	Cotta, Carlos/0000-0001-8478-7549			On the Use of Self-* Island-based Evolutionary Computation Methods on Complex Environments								COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS				15	3			733	750		10.2298/CSIS180115032N					OCT 2018	2018	We consider the use of island-based evolutionary algorithms (EAs) on fault-prone computational settings. More precisely, we consider scenarios plagued with correlated node failures. To this end, we use the sandpile model in order to induce such complex, correlated failures in the system. Several EA variants featuring self-adaptive capabilities aimed to alleviate the impact of node failures are considered, and their performance is studied in both correlated and non-correlated scenarios for increasingly large volatility rates. Simple island-based EAs are shown to have a significant performance degradation in the correlated scenario with respect to its uncorrelated counterpart. Resilience is however much improved via the use of self-* properties (self-scaling and self-healing), which leads to a more gentle degradation profile. The inclusion of self-generation also contributes to boost performance, leading to negligible degradation in the scenarios considered.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1820-0214			WOS:000446686100013		J	KhudaBukhsh, Ashiqur R.; Carbonell, Jaime G.; Jansen, Peter J.

In order for the referral network to improve over time, the experts must learn to estimate the topical expertise of other experts. This article extends concepts from Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning and Active Learning to referral networks for distributed learning in referral networks. Among a wide array of algorithms evaluated, Distributed Interval Estimation Learning (DIEL), based on Interval Estimation Learning, was found to be superior for learning appropriate referral choices, compared to ?-Greedy, Q-learning, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) methods. In addition to a synthetic data set, we compare the performance of the stronger learning-to-refer algorithms on a referral network of high-performance Stochastic Local Search (SLS) SAT solvers where expertise does not obey any known parameterized distribution. An evaluation of overall network performance and a robustness analysis is conducted across the learning algorithms, with an emphasis on capacity constraints and evolving networks, where experts with known expertise drop off and new experts of unknown performance enter situations that arise in real-world scenarios but were heretofore ignored.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0925-9902	1573-7675		WOS:000444479900001		J	Tang, Changbing; Li, Ang; Li, Xiang								Asymmetric Game: A Silver Bullet to Weighted Vertex Cover of Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS				48	10			2994	3005		10.1109/TCYB.2017.2754919					OCT 2018	2018	Weighted vertex cover (WVC), a generalized type of vertex cover, is one of the most important combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we provide a novel solution to the WVC problem from the view of network engineering. We model the WVC problem as an asymmetric game on weighted networks, where each vertex is treated as an intelligent rational agent rather than an inanimate one. Under the framework of asymmetric game, we find that strict Nash equilibriums of the asymmetric game are the intermediate states between the WVC states and the minimum WVC (MWVC) states. Besides, we propose best response algorithms with memory and feedback to solve the WVC problem, and find that a better approximate solution to the MWVC can be obtained under the feedback-based best response algorithm. Numerical illustrations verify the performance of the proposed game solution on weighted networks. Our findings pave a new way to solve the WVC problem from the perspective of asymmetric game, which opens a bottom-up avenue to address the combinatorial optimization problems.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000444827200019	29035235	J	Fitzhugh, Sean M.; Butts, Carter T.								Patterns of co-membership: Techniques for identifying subgraph composition								SOCIAL NETWORKS				55				1	10		10.1016/j.socnet.2018.03.006					OCT 2018	2018	Different social processes give rise to network structures with distinctive properties. In this paper our goal is to identify the social processes that give rise to distinct network structures (specifically, subgroups). We examine particular structural meta-relations by identifying the properties of individuals associated with specific subgroups. Clues to the process of group formation and the context in which these groups form and persist may be extracted from the properties of individuals in those groups. Following this intuition, we propose a general technique for identifying systematic patterns of attribute occupancy to determine how individual attributes may drive group formation. To connect the social context in which groups form to their structural signatures, we relate subgroup composition to nodal attributes. We illustrate the utility of comparing subgroup (e.g., clique, n-clique, k-core, etc.) co-membership with nodal co-membership in a variety of attributes. The correlations between these two co-membership matrices illustrate clearly the strength of association between shared attributes and shared subgraph membership. Furthermore, examining these correlations across groups of different sizes indicates where these attributes are most strongly associated with group co-membership. Additionally, these correlations fit well into a QAP framework to determine where shared subgraph membership has a stronger (or weaker) relation to shared attribute membership than we would expect by chance. We demonstrate the technique with a series of large, online friendship networks on the order of thousands of nodes to illustrate how factors such as gender, cohort, residence, and other attributes are associated with co-membership across a range of clique sizes.

We combine these factors as explanatory variables in different exponential random graph models (ERGMs) to assess the relative strength of prestige and homophily for the actors' link formation. We analyze the climate change discourse in a hyperlink network formed by US civil society actors from November 2014 and test how relevant the different factors are, including variables such as actor type, country, position, and topic. We find that both prestige and various aspects of homophily influence link formation online. With regard to the importance of the different factors, positional homophily stands out, followed by prestige and other homophily effects. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The developed artificial markets are multi-assets, order-driven and populated by agents having heterogeneous behaviors and information. Agents are defined by their information and their herd behavior levels. Agents trade multiple risky assets based on their wealth, their behaviors and their available information which spread among multiple behavioral networks. In a novel contribution to artificial stock markets literature, agents' behaviors modeling is mixed with social network simulation to reproduce different degrees of information asymmetry and herd behavior based on several assortative topologies. Several simulations validated the proposed model since univariate and multivariate stylized facts were reproduced both for mature and immature stock markets. The proposed artificial stock market can be considered as a first step toward decision and simulation tools for optimal management, strategy analysis and predictions evolution of immature stock markets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1860-711X	1860-7128		WOS:000443200400003		J	Wang, Juan; Li, Chao; Xia, Chengyi								Improved centrality indicators to characterize the nodal spreading capability in complex networks								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				334				388	400		10.1016/j.amc.2018.04.028					OCT 1 2018	2018	In this paper, we deeply investigate the identification of influential spreaders in complex networks based on various centrality indices. At first, we introduce several frequently used centrality indices to characterize the node influence. Then, based on the standard SIR model, we integrate various centrality indicators into the characterization of the nodal spreading capability, and then starting from the gravitational centrality formula, we systematically compare the ranking similarity and monotonicity under various centrality algorithms over 6 real-world networks and Barabasi-Albert model networks. The extensive simulations indicate that the mixed measure of gravitational centrality combining the k-shell value and degree will display the best performance as far as the ranking results are concerned, in which the focal node used the k-shell value as his mass while his neighboring nodes viewed the degree value as their masses. The current results are beneficial for us to develop the effective methods to discover and protect the significant nodes within many networked systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Often, however, excessive synchronization needs to be avoided, as it can lead to dysfunctional states, for instance, epileptic seizures in the brain. We explored the impact of network structure on the dynamics of synchronization suppression. For this purpose, we considered two network structures: 1) Barabasi-Albert scale-free and 2) Watts-Strogatz small-world, networks. The dynamics of each network takes the form of a generalized Kuramoto model, in which contrarian nodes suppress network synchronization. For each type of network structure, we used three different strategies for selecting contrarian nodes: 1) random selection, 2) selection of high-degree nodes, and 3) selection of driver nodes. We examined the influence of network structure on the desynchronization dynamics of the entire system. Our results showed that the network structure affects the dynamics of synchronization suppression. However, this impact depends on the contrarian selection strategy: 1) When the contrarians are selected randomly, the influence of small-world structure is more on synchronization suppression. 2) With high-degree nodes as contrarians, their desynchronization impact is largely the same in both network structures. 3) With driver nodes as contrarians, the impact of network structures in desynchronization dynamics is more remarkable. In other words, the difference between order parameters in two different structures is larger. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.

In this work, we propose a priority policy where packets are prioritized according to their destination. This procedure is applied to a fraction f of nodes; packets are classified as High Priority if their destinations are among the fraction f, otherwise the packets are treated as Low Priority. Using numerical simulation we found that the prioritization of nodes with high degree (hubs) is always more efficient than the prioritization of nodes with small degree or the random prioritization of nodes. Moreover, we observed three regimes based on the prioritized fraction f in the network: the first one is characterized by an improvement of the High Priority Traffic (HPT) flow without any degradation of the flow of the Low Priority Traffic (LPT). In the second regime, the HPT gains some performance at the expense of a loss of the performance in the LPT flow. While in the last regime the LPT experiences a low performance without any noticeable improvement in HPT compared to the normal flow.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000444762800013		J	Jin, Cheng; Yin, Chunji; Jin, Xiaogang; Min, Yong; Li, Yixiao; Chen, Nuole; Huang, Jiaxuan					huang, jia xuan/0000-0003-1817-225X			Group-based rewiring rules of binary opinion competition dynamics								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						14423	10.1038/s41598-018-32678-7					SEP 26 2018	2018	The dynamics of competing opinions on networks has attracted multi-disciplinary research. Most modelling approaches assume uniform or heterogeneous behaviour among all individuals, while the role of distinctive group behaviour is rarely addressed. Here, we consider competition occurring between two opinion groups with bound rewiring rules, i.e., opinion-preferred rewiring, degreepreferred rewiring and random rewiring. When two opinions share a balanced initial proportion, opinion-preferred rewiring is superior to the other rules under low rewiring rates, and coexistence occurs under high rewiring rates. For unbalanced proportions, the best response rule for the minority/ majority is unfixed, and this depends on the initial proportion and rewiring frequency. Furthermore, we find evolution processes for all competing cases belong to two categories. Evolution Category I shows an obvious correlation between opinion proportions and the density of discordant edges (connecting nodes with different opinions), and these trends can be effectively described by numerical approximations. However, for Evolution Category II, no such correlation exists for individuals or linking pairs, and an analysis of local structures reveals the emergence of large numbers of open triads with the same opinions, denoting group prevalence. This work broadens the understanding of opinion competition and inspires exploring group strategies employed in social dynamic systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000445615100052	30258094	J	Kaminski, Maciej; Blinowska, Katarzyna J.

Connectivity between any two nodes is established when the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) between the corresponding time series is greater than or equal to a threshold H, resulting in similarity networks with interesting properties. In particular, these networks can have high average clustering coefficients and the "small world" property, and their degree distribution can vary from scale-free to quasiconstant depending on H. A giant component of size N exists until a critical threshold H-c is crossed, at which point relatively rare walks begin to detach from it and remain isolated. This model can be used as a first step for building a null hypothesis for networks constructed from time series.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000445730900006		J	Zhang, Ronda J.; Stanley, H.

Using h-bridge and h-strength measurements in a weighted network, we extract the h-backbone core structure. We find that focusing on the h-backbone in a network allows greater simplification because it has fewer edges and thus fewer adjacent nodes. We examine three practical applications: the co-citation network in an information system, the open flight network in a social system, and coauthorship in network science publications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000445572100015	30254200	J	Molkenthin, Nora; Schroeder, Malte; Timme, Marc								Adhesion-Induced Discontinuous Transitions and Classifying Social Networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS				121	13					138301	10.1103/PhysRevLett.121.138301					SEP 25 2018	2018	Transition points mark qualitative changes in the macroscopic properties of large complex systems. Explosive transitions, exhibiting properties of both continuous and discontinuous phase transitions, have recently been uncovered in network growth processes. Real networks not only grow but often also restructure; yet common network restructuring processes, such as small world rewiring, do not exhibit phase transitions. Here, we uncover a class of intrinsically discontinuous transitions emerging in network restructuring processes controlled by adhesion-the preference of a chosen link to remain connected to its end node. Deriving a master equation for the temporal network evolution and working out an analytic solution, we identify genuinely discontinuous transitions in nongrowing networks, separating qualitatively distinct phases with monotonic and with peaked degree distributions. Intriguingly, our analysis of empirical data indicates a separation between the same two forms of degree distributions distinguishing abstract from face-to-face social networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000445603400022	30312048	J	Medina, Pablo; Clark, Jaime; Kiwi, Miguel; Torres, Felipe; Rogan, Jose; Alejandro Valdivia, Juan				Torres, Felipe/F-1314-2017; Valdivia, Juan/A-3631-2008; Rogan, Jose/B-8819-2008	Valdivia, Juan/0000-0003-3381-9904; Medina, Pablo/0000-0003-3139-042X; Kiwi, Miguel/0000-0001-8580-1912			The Stochastic Transport Dynamics of a Conserved Quantity on a Complex Network								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						14288	10.1038/s41598-018-32677-8					SEP 24 2018	2018	The stochastic dynamics of conserved quantities is an emergent phenomena observed in many complex systems, ranging from social and to biological networks. Using an extension of the Ehrenfest urn model on a complex network, over which a conserved quantity is transported in a random fashion, we study the dynamics of many elementary packets transported through the network by means of a master equation approach and compare with the mean field approximation and stochastic simulations. By use of the mean field theory, it is possible to compute an approximation to the ensemble average evolution of the number of packets in each node which, in the thermodynamic limit, agrees quite well with the results of the master equation. However, the master equation gives a more complete description of the stochastic system and provides a probabilistic view of the occupation number at each node. Of particular relevance is the standard deviation of the occupation number at each node, which is not uniform for a complex network. We analyze and compare different network topologies (small world, scale free, Erdos-Renyi, among others). Given the computational complexity of directly evaluating the asymptotic, or equilibrium, occupation number probability distribution, we propose a scaling relation with the number of packets in the network, that allows to construct the asymptotic probability distributions from the network with one packet. The approximation, which relies on the same matrix found in the mean field approach, becomes increasingly more accurate for a large number of packets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000445336600056	30250266	J	Raducha, Tomasz; Wilinski, Mateusz; Gubiec, Tomasz; Stanley, H.

The dynamics of node states and network connections is driven by both spin configuration and network topology. We consider a Hamiltonian that merges the classical Ising model and the statistical theory of correlated random networks. As a result, we obtain rich phase diagrams with different phase transitions both in the state of nodes and in the graph topology. We argue that the coupling between the spin dynamics and the structure of the network is crucial in understanding the complex behavior of real-world systems and omitting one of the approaches renders the description incomplete.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000445510800001		J	Huang, Yourui; Chen, Zhenping; Han, Tao; Liu, Xiaotao								One energy-efficient random-walk topology evolution method for underground wireless sensor networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS				19	9					1550147718800627	10.1177/1550147718800627					SEP 20 2018	2018	Aimed at the limited energy supply and imperfect topological tolerance for underground wireless sensor networks, one energy-efficient random-walk scale-free topology model is proposed in this article, and a power network topology structure with adjustable rate index gets generated. At first, the network is divided into several clusters, and the cluster heads are selected with the use of random-walk strategy. During the growth of the network, with the introduction of preferred connection for scale-free network, together with considering both the node's residual energy and the distance among nodes, nodes with larger residual energy present higher connectivity probability, so that the energy balance of the network gets realized. Simulation results show that the communication among the cluster heads selected by the proposed random-walk scale-free topology model presents not only the power-law characteristics of scale-free networks but also has better stability, higher fault tolerance, and it can still balance the energy consumption for nodes and the network and therefore can prolong the lifetime of the network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1550-1477			WOS:000445229400001		J	Ying, Bei-Wen; Yama, Kazuma				Ying, Bei-Wen/Q-9750-2019	Ying, Bei-Wen/0000-0003-2517-5686			Gene Expression Order Attributed to Genome Reduction and the Steady Cellular State in Escherichia coli								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				9						2255	10.3389/fmicb.2018.02255					SEP 20 2018	2018	Transcriptomes not only reflect the growth status but also link to the genome in bacteria. To investigate if and how genome or cellular state changes contribute to the gene expression order, the growth profile-associated transcriptomes of an assortment of genetically differentiated Escherichia coli either exponentially growing under varied conditions or in response to environmental disturbance were analyzed. A total of 168 microarray data sets representing 56 transcriptome variations, were categorized by genome size (full length or reduced) and cellular state (steady or unsteady). At the genome-wide level, the power-law distribution of gene expression was found to be significantly disturbed by the genome size but not the cellular state. At the regulatory network level, more networks with improved coordination of growth rates were observed in genome reduction than at the steady state. At the single-gene level, both genome reduction and steady state increased the correlation of gene expression to growth rate, but the enriched gene categories with improved correlations were different. These findings not only illustrate the order of gene expression attributed to genome reduction and steady cellular state but also indicate that the accessory sequences acquired during genome evolution largely participated in the coordination of transcriptomes to growth fitness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-302X			WOS:000445096600001	30294319	J	Nian, Fuzhong; Wang, Longjing; Dang, Zhongkai					Nian, Fuzhong/0000-0002-2179-0895			The epidemic network construction and immunization based on node strength								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	26					1850319	10.1142/S0217984918503190					SEP 20 2018	2018	In this paper, a new spreading network was constructed and the corresponding immunizations were proposed.

It helps us in maintaining the necessary network efficiency by limiting the transmission (lowering the weight of edges) while suppressing the spread of the epidemic. It is similar to the inflammation around the infected parts of our body, which can not only prevent the disease spreading but also protect the function of the body. First, we set the rate of transmission to be proportional to the edge weight based on the S-I epidemic spreading model. Then, we show the detailed dynamic evolution of the infected nodes which facilitates an effective epidemic control. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the new immunization strategy can be used to prevent the epidemic spreading effectively, while maintaining the high efficiency of the network.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000443149900005		J	Tanaka-Ishii, Kumiko								Long-Range Correlation Underlying Childhood Language and Generative Models								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				9						1725	10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01725					SEP 19 2018	2018	Long-range correlation, a property of time series exhibiting relevant statistical dependence between two distant subsequences, is mainly studied in the statistical physics domain and has been reported to exist in natural language. By using a state-of-the-art method for such analysis, long-range correlation is first shown to occur in long CHILDES data sets. To understand why, generative stochastic models of language, originally proposed in the cognitive scientific domain, are investigated. Among representative models, the Simon model is found to exhibit surprisingly good long-range correlation, but not the Pitman-Yor model. Because the Simon model is known not to correctly reflect the vocabulary growth of natural languages, a simple new model is devised as a conjunct of the Simon and Pitman-Yor models, such that long-range correlation holds with a correct vocabulary growth rate. The investigation overall suggests that uniform sampling is one cause of long-range correlation and could thus have some relation with actual linguistic processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-1078			WOS:000445081200001	30283378	J	Caldu-Primo, J.

Inference of condition-specific interaction networks from epigenomic data enables the characterization of the structural plasticity that regulatory networks can acquire in different tissues of the same organism. From this perspective, uncovering specific patterns of variation by comparing network structure among tissues could provide insights into systems-level mechanisms underlying cell behavior. Following this idea, here we propose an empirical framework to analyze mammalian tissue-specific networks, focusing on characterizing and contrasting their structure and behavior in response to perturbations. We structurally represent the state of the cell/tissue by condition specific transcription factor networks generated using DNase-seq chromatin accessibility data, and we profile their systems behavior in terms of the structural robustness against random and directed perturbations. Using this framework, we unveil the structural heterogeneity existing among tissues at different levels of differentiation. We uncover a novel and conserved systems property of regulatory networks underlying embryonic stem cells (ESCs): in contrast to terminally differentiated tissues, the promiscuous regulatory connectivity of ESCs produces a globally homogeneous network resulting in increased structural robustness. We show that this property is associated with a more permissive, less restrictive chromatin accesibility state in ESCs. Possible biological consequences of this property are discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000444762700052	30224745	J	Tejedor, Alejandro; Longjas, Anthony; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi; Georgiou, Tryphon T.; Moreno, Yamir				Georgiou, Tryphon/Q-3075-2019; Moreno, Yamir/A-1076-2009; Tejedor, Alejandro/D-5356-2018	Georgiou, Tryphon/0000-0003-0012-5447; Moreno, Yamir/0000-0002-0895-1893; Tejedor, Alejandro/0000-0002-3800-5304; Foufoula-Georgiou, Efi/0000-0003-1078-231X			Diffusion Dynamics and Optimal Coupling in Multiplex Networks with Directed Layers								PHYSICAL REVIEW X				8	3					031071	10.1103/PhysRevX.8.031071					SEP 17 2018	2018	Multiplex networks have been intensively studied during the last few years as they offer a more realistic representation of many interdependent and multilevel complex networked systems. However, even if most real networks have some degree of directionality, the vast majority of the existent literature deals with multiplex networks where all layers are undirected. Here, we study the dynamics of diffusion processes acting on coupled multilayer networks where at least one layer consists of a directed graph; we call these directed multiplex networks. We reveal a new and unexpected signature of diffusion dynamics on directed multiplex networks, namely, that different from their undirected counterparts, they can exhibit a nonmonotonic rate of convergence to steady state as a function of the degree of coupling, resulting in a faster diffusion at an intermediate degree of coupling than when the two layers arc fully coupled. We use synthetic multiplex examples and real-world topologies to illustrate the characteristics of the underlying dynamics that give rise to a regime in which an optimal coupling exists. We further provide analytical and numerical evidence that this new phenomenon is solely a property of directed multiplex, where at least one of the layers exhibits sufficient directionality quantified by a normalized metric of asymmetry in directional path lengths. Given the ubiquity of both directed and multilayer networks in nature, our results have important implications for studying the dynamics of multilevel complex systems.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2160-3308			WOS:000444780300001		J	Wen, Xiangxi; Tu, Congliang; Wu, Minggong; Jiang, Xurui								Fast ranking nodes importance in complex networks based on LS-SVM method								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				506				11	23		10.1016/j.physa.2018.03.076					SEP 15 2018	2018	Achieving high accuracy and comprehensiveness in node importance evaluation of complex networks is time-consuming. To solve this problem, a method based on Least Square Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) was proposed. Firstly, four complicated importance indicators which reflect the node importance globally and comprehensively were selected. Then analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was applied to obtain the node's importance evaluation. On this basis, three simple indicators with low computational complexity were proposed, and LS-SVM was adopted to find the mapping rules between simple indicators and AHP evaluation. The experiments on artificial network and actual network show the validity of proposed method: the evaluation based on complicated indicators is consistent with reality and reflects node importance accurately; simple indicators evaluation by LS-SVM saved a lot of computational time and improved the evaluating efficiency. Our method can provide guidance on influential node identification in large scale complex networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This paper aims to investigate the combined impact of the internal and external factors on the efficiency of rumor spreading over the social networks. In this paper, firstly, a modified ISR rumor spreading model on heterogeneous networks by taking into account the activity and infectivity of nodes and propagation environment was introduced. Then, through theoretical analysis, we derive the mean field equations with considering nonlinear spreading rate and active network nodes. Next, we calculate the basic reproduction number No based on the next generation matrix method whose results reveal that if H-0 < 1, the rumor-free equilibrium is global asymptotically stable, the rumors will disappear. If H-0 > 1, the rumor-endemic equilibrium is global attractivity, then the number of spreaders will remain stable and the rumors will become endemic. Further, some numerical simulations are performed, which is consistent with the deterministic mean-field approach. Our results show that it is very important to consider the internal and external factors to control the spread of the rumors. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In most current studies, a basic assumption is that each node in the network serves the same function and shares the same capacity redundancy. However, many real networked systems may have heterogeneous node functions. In this paper, we consider a data-transmission network which contains two types of nodes: routers and hosts, and study how the capacity redundancy of different nodes affects network robustness. It is well acknowledged that more capacity redundancy usually leads to better network robustness. However, we observe a counter-intuitive phenomenon that the increase of some nodes' capacity redundancy sometimes results in the decline of the whole network's robustness. Next, we try to explain this paradox of capacity redundancy by analyzing the process of cascading failure on a small-size scale-free network, and find that this abnormal phenomenon is related to a particular structure in both theoretical and realistic scale-free networks. Our results advance understanding of the robustness for networks with heterogeneous node functions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The weight factor makes it more difficult to calculate the topological characteristics such as average weighted shortest path (AWSP) and average receiving time (ART) of the networks. We first calculate some basic network measurements such as average degree and average node strength. Then we derive the expression for AWSP and show that it stays bounded with network order growing (0 < r < 1) in the limit of large network order. At last, we focus on random walks and trapping issue on the networks. That is, we calculate the ART. In more detail: for 0 < r < 1/2, the ART grows with increasing size N-t as In N-t; for r = 1/2, the ART grows with increasing size N-t as In2Nt; for 1/2 < r < 1, the ART grows sublinearly with the network size N-t; for r = 1, the ART grows linearly with the network size N-t.

Prominent in this context is the centrality measures, which aim at quantifying the relative importance of individual nodes in the overall topology with regard to network organization and function. However, most of the previous centrality measures have been proposed based on different concepts and each of them focuses on a specific structural feature of networks. Thus, the straightforward and standard methods may lead to some bias against node importance measure. In this paper, we introduce two physical processes with potential complementarity between them. Then we propose to combine them as an elegant integration with the classic eigenvector centrality framework to improve the accuracy of node ranking. To test the produced power iteration ranking (PIRank) algorithm, we apply it to the selection of attack targets in network optimal attack problem. Extensive experimental results on synthetic networks and real-world networks suggest that the proposed centrality performs better than other well-known measures. Moreover, comparing with the eigenvector centrality, the PIRank algorithm can achieve about thirty percent performance improvement while keeping similar running time. Our experiment on random networks also shows that PIRank algorithm can avoid the localization phenomenon of eigenvector centrality, in particular for the networks with high-degree hubs.

People in a mobile social network sometimes share rumor messages with the contacts in the group that are not necessarily familiar with them. They normally get the rumor messages posted by different users and forward them to the other individuals or groups. There are some models for analysis of rumor propagation in mobile social networks. However, none of them have considered the concept of rumor propagation into groups of nodes. In this paper we study the rumor spreading in mobile social networks when the concept of group propagation is also considered. For this purpose, we extend the SIR information propagation model and investigate the impact of group propagation on the dynamics of rumor spreading process. We conduct steady-state analysis to investigate the basic reproduction number of the rumor spreading in the model. Furthermore, agent-based modeling and simulation is used to analyze the final size of the rumor under various group propagation rates as well as the impacts of group parameters on group spreading dynamics. The simulation results obtained by Monte Carlo method show that group propagation effectively increases the rumor spreading speed. We show that having large groups is more effective on rumor spreading than having more groups. Furthermore we analyze the influence of network structure on rumor spreading when group propagation is considered. For this purpose, two Erdlis-Renyi and Barabasi-Albert models of social networks are considered and it is shown that rumor spreading behavior in these networks have no significant differences when we have rumor propagation in groups.

Directed by the special structure of the power based game, effects of investors' power correlations in the power-based game on networks are studied in this paper. The power correlations, also called the degree correlation in the traditional theory of graph, is usually measured by the assortativity coefficient r. Firstly, we theoretically show that the expected payoff of a cooperator is more than that of a defector as the level of assotativity is high enough. Meanwhile, our simulation results show that, an increment of assortativity coefficient raises the average payoffs of cooperators and boosts cooperations, verifying the theoretical inference. Furthermore, as the market efficiency a swings, the density of cooperators will be higher and more stable on the network with the larger r. As the network of investment in real world may possess both of the properties of BA scale-free networks and assortative networks, the findings may be helpful in managing the emergence of cooperative behaviors.

Based on the GPS trajectory data of 14, 139 taxis, a kind of urban trip complex network was constructed. The clustering coefficient, average shortest path, vertex intensity, network density, K-core and other indexes that reflect the complex network characteristics of the taxis were studied, and the topological properties and geographical characteristics were analyzed. Xi'an's taxi transport network has small-world characteristics and group characteristics, and that the average taxi trip is mainly 5.756 km. Distribution of vertex intensity in the traffic zones (minimum spatial analysis unit of transport network study) of the taxi network is uneven, which presents "fewer vertexes in large zones but more in the small ones," characteristic. The traffic zones with high cohesion are shaped as British Union Jack. Obviously, the research results indicate the interaction relationship between the topology structure and spatial differentiation of taxi trip trajectory network, and reveals urban resident activities' spatial characteristics, movement rules and the mutual influence of urban functions' spatial layout and resident activities, which may serve as references for those trying to optimize the taxi transport network and taxi operation management.

Consequently, evaluating how many clients are affected by preferential information distributed in online social networks has become essential. In this paper, a novel dynamic model called the follower super forwarder client (FSFC) model is proposed to address the spreading behavior of preferential information in online social networks. The mean field theory is adopted to describe the formulas of the FSFC model and the key parameters of the model are derived from the past forwarding data of the preferential information. The edge between a large-degree node to a small-degree node has a greater weight. In addition, two kinds of infection probabilities are adopted for large degree node forwarders and small-degree node forwarders. To evaluate the performance of the FSFC model, preferential data published on the Sina microblog (www.weibo.com) for the Vivo smartphone, Alibaba's Tmall shopping site, and the Xiaomi phone were selected as real cases.

Here, the Ising model on multiplex networks with two layers is considered, with spins located in the nodes and edges corresponding to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions between them. Critical temperatures for the spin glass and ferromagnetic transitions are evaluated for the layers in the form of random Erdos-Renyi graphs or heterogeneous scale free networks using the replica method, from the replica symmetric solution. Stability of this solution is investigated and location of the de Almeida-Thouless line is determined. For the (sing model on multiplex networks with scale-free layers it is shown that the critical temperature is finite if the distributions of the degrees of nodes within both layers have a finite second moment, and that depending on the model parameters the transition can be to the ferromagnetic or spin glass phase. It is also shown that the correlation between the degrees of nodes within different layers significantly influences the critical temperatures and the phase diagram. The scaling behavior for the spin glass order parameter is determined and it is shown that for the Ising model on multiplex networks with scale-free layers the scaling exponents can depend on the distributions of the degrees of nodes within layers. The analytic results are partly confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations using the parallel tempering algorithm. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The evidence of synchronization ranges from the elementary biological organisms to the most sophisticated human societies. In this paper, the problem of synchronization of nonlinearly coupled dynamical networks of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons with a sigmoidal coupling function is addressed. Sufficient condition for synchrony in terms of network structure is developed. A study on the basis of attraction of the complete synchronization is carried out for different structured networks. Also the phase synchronization of dynamical network of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons are studied. The impact of different structural properties of complex network on the phase synchronization are analyzed. The synchronization of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons are evaluated and compared on different structured network like random, regular, small-world, scale-free and modular networks. Interestingly, it was found that networks with high clustering coefficient and neutral degree mixing pattern promote better synchronization. Some chimera like state are also found in different structural networks. Further the effect of time delay dynamics on the synchronization of nonlinearly coupled network of Hindmarsh-Rose neurons are illustrated.

Considering the space constraint, dependency links between networks may be established not globally but locally. In this paper, we study how the spatial coupling will impact the robustness of interdependent scale-free networks located in a 2D square plane where dependent nodes are connected within a connecting radius r(connert). Besides the traditional assortative degree-degree coupling (GD) and random coupling (GR), some novel spatial couplings are also introduced, i.e., spatial assortative degree-degree coupling (SD), spatial random coupling (SR) and nearest neighbor coupling (NN). Simulation results indicate that assortative couplings, GD and SD, can improve the robustness under topological attacks while under localized attacks, NN coupling is the best one. In addition, for SD coupling under topological attacks, we find that the robustness for small r(connect) decreases with r(connect) from 0 to the critical value r(c1), and for larger r(connect) gradually increases with r(connect) from r(c1) to the maximum value (r(connect))(max). However, opposite results will be obtained under localized attacks. These findings may be helpful to understand and analyze some real interdependent infrastructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examine how such shocks affect multiplex networks via an agent-based model, in which agents add, drop, or change ties to increase their utility. At a certain time-point, some agents are "shocked" by changing (increasing or decreasing) the cost associated with tie-formation or tie-maintenance. Our model makes several improvements to previous models, including (a) only a fraction of nodes are shocked to simulate small wars or scattered tariff increases or decreases and (b) agents can make both utility-maximizing decisions and randomly rewire ties to explore the utility landscape. Interestingly, we find that randomly rewiring ties increases the utility of agents, for reasons similar to simulated annealing in physics. Furthermore, we create a novel metric to determine how networks change after a shock and find that the size of a shock and noise significantly changes the network, but only when agents' incentives for tie-formation are sufficiently high. Together, these results suggest that adding more realism to cooperation network models can give nuanced understanding to network shocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000444279000025	30206261	J	Pan, Xing; Wang, Huixiong				Wang, Huixiong/M-3891-2019	Wang, Huixiong/0000-0002-8954-1967			Resilience of and recovery strategies for weighted networks								PLOS ONE				13	9					e0203894	10.1371/journal.pone.0203894					SEP 11 2018	2018	The robustness and resilience of complex networks have been widely studied and discussed in both research and industry because today, the diversity of system components and the complexity of the connection between units are increasingly influencing the reliability of complex systems. Previous studies have focused on node failure in networks, proposing several performance indicators. However, a single performance indicator cannot comprehensively measure all the performance aspects; thus, the selected performance indicators and recovery strategies lack consistency with respect to the targeted complex systems. This paper introduces a novel stress-strength-balanced weighted network model based on two network transmission hypotheses. Then, with respect to different concerns of the complex network, we propose two modified network performance measurement indicators and compare these indicators in terms of their trends in the attack process. In addition, we introduce several network recovery strategies and compare their efficiencies. Our findings are as follows: (1) The evaluation and judgment of the network performance depend on the performance measurement indicators we use. (2) Different recovery strategies exhibit distinct efficiencies in recovering different aspects of network performance, and no strategy exists that can improve all the network performance aspects simultaneously. (3) The timing of the recovery is proved to have a deep influence on the cost and efficiency of network recovery; thus, the optimal recovery strategy for a damaged network varies with the extent of the damage. From the results of the simulation of the attack-recovery process, we conclude that while defining and analyzing complex network models, we should adjust our network topology, weight assignment, and performance indicators in accordance with the focal characteristics of complex systems so that we can use the network model to build robust complex systems and efficient logistics and maintenance strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000444355500055	30204786	J	Wandelt, Sebastian; Sun, Xiaoqian; Feng, Daozhong; Zanin, Massimiliano; Havlin, Shlomo								A comparative analysis of approaches to network-dismantling								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						13513	10.1038/s41598-018-31902-8					SEP 10 2018	2018	Estimating, understanding, and improving the robustness of networks has many application areas such as bioinformatics, transportation, or computational linguistics. Accordingly, with the rise of network science for modeling complex systems, many methods for robustness estimation and network dismantling have been developed and applied to real-world problems. The state-of-the-art in this field is quite fuzzy, as results are published in various domain-specific venues and using different datasets. In this study, we report, to the best of our knowledge, on the analysis of the largest benchmark regarding network dismantling. We reimplemented and compared 13 competitors on 12 types of random networks, including ER, BA, and WS, with different network generation parameters. We find that network metrics, proposed more than 20 years ago, are often non-dominating competitors, while many recently proposed techniques perform well only on specific network types. Besides the solution quality, we also investigate the execution time. Moreover, we analyze the similarity of competitors, as induced by their node rankings. We compare and validate our results on real-world networks. Our study is aimed to be a reference for selecting a network dismantling method for a given network, considering accuracy requirements and run time constraints.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000444086700025	30202039	J	Bradler, Kamil; Dallaire-Demers, Pierre-Luc; Rebentrost, Patrick; Su, Daiqin; Weedbrook, Christian								Gaussian boson sampling for perfect matchings of arbitrary graphs								PHYSICAL REVIEW A				98	3					032310	10.1103/PhysRevA.98.032310					SEP 10 2018	2018	A famously hard graph problem with a broad range of applications is computing the number of perfect matchings, that is, the number of unique and complete pairings of the vertices of a graph. We propose a method to estimate the number of perfect matchings of undirected graphs based on the relation between Gaussian boson sampling and graph theory. The probability of measuring zero or one photons in each output mode is directly related to the hafnian of the adjacency matrix, and thus to the number of perfect matchings of a graph. We present encodings of the adjacency matrix of a graph into a Gaussian state and show strategies to boost the sampling success probability for the studied graphs. With our method, a Gaussian boson sampling device can be used to estimate the number of perfect matchings significantly faster and with lower-energy consumption compared to a classical computer.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2469-9926	2469-9934		WOS:000444202100004		J	Farrell, Spencer G.; Mitnitski, Arnold B.; Theou, Olga; Rockwood, Kenneth; Rutenberg, Andrew D.

We find that individual health attributes exhibit a wide range of mutual information with mortality and that, with a reconstruction of their relative connectivity, higher-ranked nodes are more informative. Surprisingly, we find a broad and overlapping range of mutual information of laboratory measures as compared with clinical measures. We confirm similar behavior between most-connected and least-connected model nodes, controlled by the nearest-neighbor connectivity. Furthermore, in both model and observational data, we find that the least-connected (laboratory) nodes are damaged earlier than the mostconnected (clinical) deficits. A mean-field theory of our network model captures and explains this phenomenon, which results from the connectivity of nodes and of their connected neighbors. We find that other network topologies, including random, small-world, and assortative scale-free networks, exhibit qualitatively different behavior. Our disassortative scale-free network model behaves consistently with our expanded phenomenology observed in human aging and so is a useful tool to explore mechanisms of and to develop predictive measures for human aging and mortality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000444211400003		J	De Nicola, Rocco; Di Stefano, Luca; Inverso, Omar				Di Stefano, Luca/O-6976-2017; Di Stefano, Luca/K-3124-2019	Di Stefano, Luca/0000-0003-1922-3151; Di Stefano, Luca/0000-0003-1922-3151			Toward Formal Models and Languages for Verifiable Multi-Robot Systems								FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI				5						94	10.3389/frobt.2018.00094					SEP 5 2018	2018	Incorrect operation of a multi-robot system (MRS) may not only lead to unsatisfactory results, but it can also cause economic losses and jeopardize safety. These risks may not always be evident, since they may arise as unforeseen consequences of interactions between different components of the system. Thus, tools and techniques that can help in providing guarantees about the behavior of MRSs are on demand; whenever possible, these guarantees should be backed up by formal proofs complementing the traditional approaches based on testing and simulation. Tailored linguistic support to specify MRSs is a major step toward this goal. In fact, reducing the gap between typical features of an MRS and the linguistic primitives used to model them would simplify both the specification of these systems and their verification. With the aim of reducing this gap, we identified some key features of MRSs in this work. Subsequently, we considered the selection of three specification languages oriented toward MRSs, which are representative of wider categories of languages with similar aims. Finally, we assessed the extent to which the considered languages captured the key features in an adequate and intuitive way by using them to implement multi-robot systems case studies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-9144			WOS:000443780900001		J	Shen, Ai-Zhong; Guo, Jin-Li; Wu, Guo-Lin; Jia, Shu-Wei								The agglomeration phenomenon influence on the scaling law of the scientific collaboration system								CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				114				461	467		10.1016/j.chaos.2018.07.037					SEP 2018	2018	This paper presents a scientific collaboration hypernetwork evolution model with adjustable clustering coefficient in which the authors are regarded as nodes and the hyperedges are the cooperative articles. Firstly, we build the scientific cooperation hypernetwork through the real paper data which comes from the database of arxive. The empirical results show that the node's hyperdegree follows the power law distribution, but the hyperedge's node-degree has the exponent distribution. In addition, we establish the scientific collaboration clustering hypernetwork evolution model by employing the Poisson process theory and the continuous method for studying the agglomeration phenomenon of scientific cooperation system. The theoretical analysis shows that the node's hyperdegree distribution has scale-free characteristics. The power index of our model is independent of the clustering coefficient, and the theoretical analyses agree with the conducted numerical simulations. Moreover, our model not only describes the scale-free property, but also depicts the phenomenon of agglomeration. Both the properties are usually coexist in the scientific cooperation, our model is more actual. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, most of them were not efficient in inferring regulatory relations involved by a large number of genes because they limited the number of regulatory genes or computed an approximated reliability of multivariate relations. Therefore, an improved method is needed to efficiently search more generalized and scalable regulatory relations.Results: In this study, we propose a genetic algorithm-based Boolean network inference (GABNI) method which can search an optimal Boolean regulatory function of a large number of regulatory genes. For an efficient search, it solves the problem in two stages. GABNI first exploits an existing method, a mutual information-based Boolean network inference (MIBNI), because it can quickly find an optimal solution in a small-scale inference problem. When MIBNI fails to find an optimal solution, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to search an optimal set of regulatory genes in a wider solution space. In particular, we modified a typical GA framework to efficiently reduce a search space. We compared GABNI with four well-known inference methods through extensive simulations on both the artificial and the real gene expression datasets. Our results demonstrated that GABNI significantly outperformed them in both structural and dynamics accuracies. Conclusion: The proposed method is an efficient and scalable tool to infer a Boolean network from time-series gene expression data.					17th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB)17th European Conference on Computational Biology (ECCB)	SEP 08-12, 2018SEP 08-12, 2018		Athens, GREECEAthens, GREECE	0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000444317200040	30423074	J	Soriano-Panos, D.; Arias-Castro, H.; Naranjo-Mayorga, F.; Gomez-Gardenes, J.

We first present this generalized model by formulating a mean field theory, checking its validity by comparing to numerical simulations. To make the premises of our model more realistic, we adapt the mean field equations to the case in which human contacts are described by a complex network. In this case we are also able to derive an analytical expression for the epidemic threshold. In both the mean-field and network-based models, we estimate the value of the epidemic threshold which corresponds to the boundary between the disease-free and epidemic regimes. The expression of this threshold allows us to discuss the impact that human-to-human contagions have on the spread of vector-borne diseases.

We provide a rationale for this, based on a simple proportional growth with birth and death model previously employed to describe the size distribution of firms, cities, webpages, etc. We empirically validate the model and its main predictions, in terms of proportional growth (Gibrat's Law) of the coins and tokens. Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space. The theory predicts that the exponent for tokens should converge to 1 in the future, reflecting a more reasonable rate of new entrants associated with genuine technological innovations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2054-5703			WOS:000446259700013	30839686	J	Shen, Dongqin; Cao, Shanshan								An efficient immunization strategy based on transmission limit in weighted complex networks								CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				114				1	7		10.1016/j.chaos.2018.06.014					SEP 2018	2018	The immunization strategy against the epidemic spreading in real world has attracted widespread attention of scientists from many different fields. However, the traditional immune behavior is achieved by deleting the edges in the network, which can lead to variations in the network structure and consequently serious damage to the efficiency of networks. In this paper, we studied a new type of immune strategy applied to weighted networks, which is to maintain the necessary network efficiency by limit the transmission(reduce the weight of edges) to suppress the spread of epidemic. It is similar to the inflammation around the infected parts of our body, which not only prevent epidemic from further spreading but also do no harm to the function of the body. We first set the rate of transmission be proportional to the edge weight according to the S-I epidemic spreading model. Then, we propose the specific dynamic evolution model for infected nodes that boosts efficient epidemic control. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the immunization strategy can efficaciously prevent the spread of the epidemic, while maintaining the high efficiency of the network.

The novelty comes in the form of using nonlinear dynamic concepts to construct the temporal streamflow network. The approach involves three steps. First, the single-variable streamflow time series is represented in a multidimensional phase space using delay embedding, i.e. phase space reconstruction. Next, this reconstructed phase space is treated as a network, with the reconstructed vectors (instead of the streamflow values themselves) serving as the nodes and the connections between them serving as the links. Finally, the strength of each node in the network is determined using a distance metric. The approach is employed independently to monthly streamflow time series observed over a period of 53 years (January 1950-December 2002) from each of 639 stations in the contiguous United States. For each time series, different delay time values for phase space reconstruction are considered and the optimum embedding dimension is determined using the false nearest neighbor (FNN) method. The results indicate the usefulness of the phase space reconstruction-based network construction for examining the temporal connections in streamflow. The distribution of the strengths of nodes for any streamflow network is used to identify the type of the underlying network. The average node strength of each of the 639 streamflow networks are also interpreted: (1) to identify similarities and differences between the stations; (2) to explain the role of catchment and flow properties (drainage area, elevation, and flow mean) on network strength; and (3) to assess the influence of time (i.e. month of the year) on network strength.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1694	1879-2707		WOS:000445316200005		J	Cui, Pengshuai; Zhu, Peidong; Xun, Peng; Shao, Chengcheng					Shao, Chengcheng/0000-0002-5479-2256			Robustness of Cyber-Physical Systems against Simultaneous, Sequential and Composite Attack								ELECTRONICS				7	9					196	10.3390/electronics7090196					SEP 2018	2018	In this paper, a failure model of Cyber-Physical systems and an attack model are proposed.

Through numerical simulations, we find that: (1) the sequential attack may bring more damage in single physical systems; (2) the coupling process of cyber system and physical systems makes it possible that sequential attack causes more damage than simultaneous attacks when the attackers only attack the cyber system; (3) with some target sets, composite attack leads to more failures than both simultaneous attack and sequential attack. The above results suggest that defenders should take all the three kinds of attacks into account when they select the critical nodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2079-9292			WOS:000448397200043		J	Connor-Streich, Gabriel; Henshaw, Alexander J.; Brasington, James; Bertoldi, Walter; Harvey, Gemma L.

Furthermore, we still lack methods that can take full advantage of the increasing availability of remotely sensed datasets that are well suited to braided river research. Network analysis based on graph theory, the mathematics of networks, offers a largely unexplored toolbox that can be applied to remotely sensed data to quantify the structure and function of braided rivers across nearly the full range of spatiotemporal scales relevant to braided river evolution. In this article, important commonalities between braided rivers and other types of complex network are described, providing a compelling argument for the wider uptake of complex network analysis methods in the study of braided rivers. We provide an overview of the extraction of graph representations of braided river networks from remotely sensed data and detail a suite of metrics for quantitative analysis of these networks. Application of these metrics as new tools for multiscale characterization of braided river planforms that improve upon traditional, spatially averaged approaches is discussed and potential approaches to network-based analysis of braided river dynamics are proposed, drawing on a range of different concepts from braided river research and other network sciences. Finally, the potential for using graph theory metrics to validate numerical models of braided rivers is discussed.

A methodology is proposed to analyze and optimize the eco-industrial symbiosis network from the perspective of complex network theory. Structural robustness index and performance robustness index are established as the analysis model. Consequently, a robust method is developed to optimize the eco-industrial symbiosis network system based on the percolation theory. A conceptual framework is put forward to improve the robustness of eco-industrial symbiosis network system by introducing the "spare core" enterprise which is validated by quantitative analysis. The empirical results show that the robustness of eco-industrial symbiosis network varies under both random failure and intentional disturbance scenarios. However, eco-industrial symbiosis network system has strong self-regulation capability as long as the core enterprise is still in operation. It is recommended that supplementary chain could be added to those enterprises with lower network node connectivity to form "spare core" enterprise. This can not only effectively reduce the dependence of other enterprises on core enterprises, but also further improve the robustness of eco-industrial symbiosis network. This methodology is practically validated by a case analysis of eco-industrial park in China. The findings provide useful inputs to the design and operation of eco-industrial parks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0944-1344	1614-7499		WOS:000444202800047	30027377	J	Siekmann, Ivo				Siekmann, Ivo/N-9725-2019	Siekmann, Ivo/0000-0002-0706-6307			An applied mathematician's perspective on Rosennean Complexity								ECOLOGICAL COMPLEXITY				35		SI		28	38		10.1016/j.ecocom.2017.07.007					SEP 2018	2018	The theoretical biologist Robert Rosen developed a highly original approach for investigating the question "What is life?", the most fundamental problem of biology. Considering that Rosen made extensive use of mathematics it might seem surprising that his ideas have only rarely been implemented in mathematical models. On the one hand, Rosen propagates relational models that neglect underlying structural details of the components and focus on relationships between the elements of a biological system, according to the motto "throw away the physics, keep the organisation". Rosen's strong rejection of mechanistic models that he implicitly associates with a strong form of reductionism might have deterred mathematical modellers from adopting his ideas for their own work. On the other hand Rosen's presentation of his modelling framework, (M, R) systems, is highly abstract which makes it hard to appreciate how this approach could be applied to concrete biological problems. In this article, both the mathematics as well as those aspects of Rosen's work are analysed that relate to his philosophical ideas. It is shown that Rosen's relational models are a particular type of mechanistic model with specific underlying assumptions rather than a fundamentally different approach that excludes mechanistic models. The strengths and weaknesses of relational models are investigated by comparison with current network biology literature. Finally, it is argued that Rosen's definition of life, "organisms are closed to efficient causation", should be considered as a hypothesis to be tested and ideas how this postulate could be implemented in mathematical models are presented.

We follow the original definition of a pseudoword as the combination of two monosemous terms and their contexts to simulate a polysemous word. The evaluation is performed comparing the algorithm's output on a pseudoword's ego word graph (i.e., a graph that represents the pseudoword's context in the corpus) with the known subdivision given by the components corresponding to the monosemous source words forming the pseudoword. The main contribution of this article is to present a self-sufficient pseudoword-based evaluation framework for wsi graph-based clustering algorithms, thereby defining a new evaluation measure (top2) and a secondary clustering process (hyperclustering). To our knowledge, we are the first to conduct and discuss a large-scale systematic pseudoword evaluation targeting the induction of coarse-grained homonymous word senses across a large number of graph clustering algorithms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1574-020X	1574-0218		WOS:000441548800003		J	Medina, Anderson Matos								Why do ecologists search for co-authorships?

Furthermore, four potential explanations (geographic distance, word similarity, reputation asymmetry, and country development) for this pattern were evaluated.

With the increasing of iterations, the proposed approach incorporates more and more topological structure information and node attributes data. Experimental results with real-world networks have shown that the proposed solution performs better in terms of well-known metrics as compared to the existing approaches.

We construct an invisibility similarity network based on the similarity of political awareness. We find that the personal characteristics and social positions play an important role in forming the invisibility similarity network of political awareness. Surprisingly, it is found that the respondents who are self-reported in high social positions are in the periphery of the invisibility similarity network. Our work sheds new light on understanding the relationship between social positions and political awareness from the perspective of complex networks and may provide a guide in social governance.

This paper presents a novel method for network community discovery based on deep sparse filtering. The features of the network are extracted by sparse filtering, an unsupervised deep learning algorithm, from an efficient representation of the network. Consequently, extracted features are employed to partition the network. Experiment results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets indicate that the proposed algorithm especially based on Sorensen-Dice's similarity matrix representation of the network is efficient and it outperforms several state-of-art algorithms in discovering community structure.

Does it truly exhibit exponential early-growth, as predicted by the celebrated models, like the Bass model? How about the dynamics of links, for which there are few published models? For the first time, we examine the growth of WeChat which is the largest online social network in China, together with several other real social networks. We observe Power-Law growth dynamics for both nodes and links, a fact that breaks the textbook models featuring Sigmoid curves. We propose NETTIDE, along with differential equations for the growth of nodes and links. Our model fits the growth dynamics of real social networks well; it encompasses many traditional growth dynamics as special cases, while remaining parsimonious in parameters. The NETTIDE for link growth is the first one of its kind, accurately fitting real data, and capturing densification phenomenon. We further formulate two stochastic generators, which interpret the growth of nodes and links through survival analysis and micro-level interactions within a social network, respectively. The proposed generators reproduce realistic growth dynamics of social networks. When applied on the WeChat data, our NETTIDE forecasted >= 730 days ahead with 3 percent error.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1041-4347	1558-2191		WOS:000440853500008		J	Sagduyu, Yalin E.; Grushin, Alexander; Shi, Yi					Sagduyu, Yalin/0000-0003-1576-5527; Grushin, Alexander/0000-0002-4723-7967			Synthetic Social Media Data Generation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS				5	3			605	620		10.1109/TCSS.2018.2854668					SEP 2018	2018	This paper presents a novel system, synthetic high-fidelity social media data generator (SHIELD), for generating the synthetic social media data. SHIELD jointly generates time-varying, directed and weighted interaction graph structures and topic-driven text features similar to the input social media data. A synthetic interaction graph is generated by a social network model to minimize the distance to real graph and is enhanced by adding various patterns, such as anomalies and information cascades, interaction types, and temporal dynamics. A synthetic text generator based on the n-gram Markov model is trained under each topic identified by topic modeling. Synthetic text and graph structures are combined through the assignment of synthetic social media entities. Extensive performance evaluation via a graph and text analysis is provided to demonstrate the statistical fidelity of large-scale synthetic data generated by SHIELD. A data evaluation exercise with human participants is executed to identify how difficult it is for a human to distinguish between tweets that were generated by SHIELD and tweets that were posted by real users. Experimental results followed by a statistical significance analysis showed that human participants cannot reliably distinguish between real and synthetic tweets.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2329-924X			WOS:000444824900002		J	Jin, Lei; Wang, Xiaojuan; Zhang, Yong; You, Jingwen								Cascading failure in multilayer networks with dynamic dependency groups								CHINESE PHYSICS B				27	9					098901	10.1088/1674-1056/27/9/098901					SEP 2018	2018	The cascading failure often occurs in real networks. It is significant to analyze the cascading failure in the complex network research. The dependency relation can change over time. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the cascading failure in multilayer networks with dynamic dependency groups. We construct a model considering the recovery mechanism. In our model, two effects between layers are defined. Under Effect 1, the dependent nodes in other layers will be disabled as long as one node does not belong to the largest connected component in one layer. Under Effect 2, the dependent nodes in other layers will recover when one node belongs to the largest connected component. The theoretical solution of the largest component is deduced and the simulation results verify our theoretical solution. In the simulation, we analyze the influence factors of the network robustness, including the fraction of dependent nodes and the group size, in our model. It shows that increasing the fraction of dependent nodes and the group size will enhance the network robustness under Effect 1. On the contrary, these will reduce the network robustness under Effect 2. Meanwhile, we find that the tightness of the network connection will affect the robustness of networks. Furthermore, setting the average degree of network as 8 is enough to keep the network robust.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000445026000001		J	Goswami, Swati; Murthy, C.

Sparsity measure of a network graph: Gini index								INFORMATION SCIENCES				462				16	39		10.1016/j.ins.2018.05.044					SEP 2018	2018	This article explores the problem of formulating a general measure of sparsity of network graphs. Based on an available definition sparsity of a dataset, namely Gini index, it provides a way to define sparsity measure of a network graph. We name the sparsity measure so introduced as sparsity index. Sparsity measures are commonly associated with six properties, namely, Robin Hood, Scaling, Rising Tide. Cloning, Bill Gates and Babies. Sparsity index directly satisfies four of these six properties; does not satisfy Cloning and satisfies Scaling for some specific cases. A comparison of the proposed index is drawn with Edge Density (the proportion of the sum of degrees of all nodes in a graph compared to the total possible degrees in the corresponding fully connected graph), by showing mathematically that as the edge density of an undirected graph increases, its sparsity index decreases. The paper highlights how the proposed sparsity measure can reveal important properties of a network graph. Further, a relationship has been drawn analytically between the sparsity index and the exponent term of a power law distribution (a distribution known to approximate the degree distribution of a wide variety of network graphs). To illustrate application of the proposed index, a community detection algorithm for network graphs is presented. The algorithm produces overlapping communities with no input requirement on number or size of the communities; has a computational complexity O(n(2)), where n is the number of nodes of the graph. The results validated on artificial and real networks show its effectiveness. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

In our model, we observed an abrupt phase transition of packet loss rate when the packet generation rate increases, based on which we redefined the network capacity as the critical packet generation rate of packet loss. Then, we found a sharp phase transition of network capacity with the increase of packet lifetime, which is also predicted by our analytical results of network capacity. Moreover, we obtained that there is an optimal routing parameter of the tunable path routing algorithm corresponding to the maximum network capacity.

Examples include information diffusion, social influence, and participation in collective action (e.g., protests). Key players, which are typically agents characterized by structural properties of the underlying network (e.g., high degree, high core number or high centrality) are considered important for spreading social contagions. In this paper, we ask whether contagions can propagate through a population that is devoid of key players. We justify the use of ErdoIis-R,nyi random graphs as a representation of unstructured populations that lack key players, and investigate whether complex contagions-those requiring reinforcement-can spread on them. We demonstrate that two game-theoretic contagion models that utilize common knowledge for collective action can readily spread such contagions, thus differing significantly from classic complex contagion models. We compare contagion dynamics results on unstructured networks to those on more typically-studied, structured social networks to understand the role of network structure. We test the classic complex contagion and the two game-theoretic models with a total of 18 networks that range over five orders of magnitude in size and have different structural properties. The two common knowledge models are also contrasted to understand the effects of different modeling assumptions on dynamics. We show that under a wide range of conditions, these two models produce markedly different results. Finally, we demonstrate that the disparity between classic complex contagion and common knowledge models persists as network size increases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-145X	1573-1413		WOS:000442231700002		J	Tabassum, Shazia; Pereira, Fabiola S.

Therefore, this article attempts to provide a succinct overview of SNA in diverse topological networks (static, temporal, and evolving networks) and perspective (ego-networks). As one of the primary applicability of SNA is in networked data mining, we provide a brief overview of network mining models as well; by this, we present the readers with a concise guided tour from analysis to mining of networks.This article is categorized under:Application Areas > Science and TechnologyTechnologies > Machine LearningFundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge > Human Centricity and User InteractionCommercial, Legal, and Ethical Issues > Social Considerations									0	0	0	0	0	0			1942-4787	1942-4795		WOS:000441767200001		J	Stanton, Richard; Walden, Johan; Wallace, Nancy								Mortgage Loan Flow Networks and Financial Norms								REVIEW OF FINANCIAL STUDIES				31	9			3595	3642		10.1093/rfs/hhx097					SEP 2018	2018	We develop a theoretical model of a network of intermediaries whose optimal behavior is jointly determined, leading to heterogeneous financial norms and systemic vulnerabilities.

The simple version of the public goods game (PGG) has a fixed utility for a player who has at least a single neighbor buying the good. Players in the general version of PGG have additional utility when multiple neighbors purchase the good. The general version of the public goods game is shown to be a potential game, establishing the convergence to a stable state (i.e., a pure Nash equilibrium - PNE) by best-response dynamics. One can think of best-response dynamics as a distributed algorithm that runs in a fixed order of players/agents and is guaranteed to converge to a PNE.A new distributed algorithm is proposed for finding PNEs with improved efficiency by the use of transfer of payoffs among players. For the simple version of PGG, it is shown that the proposed algorithm can stabilize an outcome that maximizes social welfare. For the general version of the game, the proposed procedure transforms any initial outcome into a stable solution at least as efficient as the initial outcome by using transfers. An extensive experimental evaluation on randomly generated PGGs demonstrates that whereas pure best-response dynamics converges on stable states that have lower efficiency than the initial outcome, the proposed procedure finds PNEs of higher efficiency.

(2008) to convert a time-series into a complex network, this paper develops and proposes a novel expansion of this algorithm that allows generating a visibility graph from a complex network instead of a time-series that is currently applicable. The purpose of this approach is to apply the idea of visibility from the field of time-series to complex networks in order to interpret the network topology as a landscape. Visibility in complex networks is a multivariate property producing an associated visibility graph that maps the ability of a node "to see" other nodes in the network that lie beyond the range of its neighborhood, in terms of a control-attribute. Within this context, this paper examines the visibility topology produced by connectivity (degree) in comparison with the original (source) network, in order to detect what patterns or forces describe the mechanism under which a network is converted to a visibility graph. The overall analysis shows that visibility is a property that increases the connectivity in networks, it may contribute to pattern recognition (among which the detection of the scale-free topology) and it is worth to be applied to complex networks in order to reveal the potential of signal processing beyond the range of its neighborhood. Generally, this paper promotes interdisciplinary research in complex networks providing new insights to network science. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we propose a generalized-degree-based coarse graining (GDCG) approach to extract respectively the undirected or directed coarse-grained networks by merging the nodes with same or similar generalized degree. The new approach provides an adjustable generalized degree by parameter p for preserving some significant properties of the initial networks during the coarse-graining processes. Compared with the existing coarse-graining methods, the GDCG method is only based on the generalized degree, which is not only simple and operable, but also keeps some statistical properties and the synchronizability of the original networks. Moreover, the size of the coarse-grained networks can be chosen freely in the proposed method. Finally, extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

We propose and experiment with an agent-based simulation model of new technology diffusion to evaluate different seeding criteria, fraction of the market to seed, and inventory build-up policies under various social network structures, demand backlogging levels, and product categories. In contrast to previous findings (that are mainly based on the assumption of unlimited supply), we show that the seeding strategy that maximizes the adoption rate is not necessarily optimal in the presence of supply constraints. More importantly, we show that determining seeding and build-up policies sequentially may lead to suboptimal decisions and that the optimal combination of seeding and build-up policy varies for different product categories. We study different small-world and scale-free networks and illustrate how the distribution of long-range connections and influential nodes affect the adoption, demand backlogging, and lost sales dynamics as well as the overall profit. The important implications of the findings for diffusion research as well as marketing and operations management practice are also discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0254-5330	1572-9338		WOS:000440286100004		J	Li, Weiyu; Tian, Lixin; Batool, Humera					LI, WEIYU/0000-0002-4550-2472			Impact of negative information diffusion on green behavior adoption								RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING				136				337	344		10.1016/j.resconrec.2018.04.026					SEP 2018	2018	Apart from the technical improvements, inducing the green citizen behavior is also a key way to reduce carbon emissions. Various studies have tried to identify the determinants of green behavior. Hitherto, there lacks a quantitative analysis directed to the effects of some factor on the outbreak of green behavior and the final adopted fraction. To fill this gap, this paper propose a Heterogeneous Green Behavior Spreading (HGBS) model to explore the impacts of negative information diffusion (about the green behavior) that effects on the spreading of green behavior. Simulations are performed on top of the two-layer multiplex networks, in which individuals are involved in two processes, the information diffusion in information layer and the green behavior spreading in physical contact layer. Based on the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA) and the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, we find the slight impact of information layer would make the green behavior harder to break out and reduce the adopted fraction. Moreover, the diversity of information diffusion ways makes it worse. It suggests that the control of negative information diffusion would be helpful in contributing to low-carbon city. Another effective way is to encourage individuals having more neighbours in real world to behave pro-environmentally since the adopted fraction is increased for small degree of the individuals in physical contact layer. It is essential to consider the heterogeneity in spreading activity if one wants to model the green behavior spreading.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0921-3449	1879-0658		WOS:000437079300036		J	Luo, Yongcong; Ma, Jing								The influence of positive news on rumor spreading in social networks with scale-free characteristics								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	9					1850078	10.1142/S012918311850078X					SEP 2018	2018	We explore the impact of positive news on rumor spreading in this paper. It is a fact that most of the rumors related to hot events or emergencies can be propagated rapidly on the hotbed of online social networks. In Chinese words, it is better to divert rather than block. Therefore, we propose the spreading model ISSPR in which positive news is a good factor to guide rumor spreading. Based on transition probability method, we have got the spreading parameters of the ISSPR model by running the rumor spreading process in online social networks with scale-free characteristics. The results give a good proof that improving the activity of the positive news spreader S-P derived from the ISSPR model can guide and restrain the spreading speed of rumor smoothly.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000446918900002		J	Wu, Tianhang; Wang, Hanchen; Yang, Jian; Xu, Liang; Li, Yumeng; Zhang, Jun								The prisoner's dilemma game on scale-free networks with heterogeneous imitation capability								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	9					1850077	10.1142/S0129183118500778					SEP 2018	2018	In human societies, personal heterogeneity may affect the strategy adoption capability of the individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of heterogeneous learning ability on the evolution of cooperation by introducing heterogeneous imitation capability of players. We design a pre-factor omega(x) to represent the heterogeneous learning ability of players, which is related to the degree of players. And alpha parameter a is used to tune the learning levels. If alpha > 0, the learning ability of players decreases and the low-degree player has the higher reduction level, but if alpha < 0, the learning ability of low-degree players enhances to a higher level. By carrying out extensive simulations, it reveals that the evolution of cooperation is influenced significantly by introducing players heterogeneous learning ability and can be promoted under the right circumstances. This finding sheds some light on the important effect of individual heterogeneity on the evolutionary game.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000446918900001		J	Cecchini, Gloria; Thiel, Marco; Schelter, Bjorn; Sommerlade, Linda								Improving network inference: The impact of false positive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links								JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS				307				31	36		10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.06.011					SEP 1 2018	2018	Background: A reliable inference of networks from data is of key interest in the Neurosciences. Several methods have been suggested in the literature to reliably determine links in a network. To decide about the presence of links, these techniques rely on statistical inference, typically controlling the number of false positives, paying little attention to false negatives.New method: In this paper, by means of a comprehensive simulation study, we analyse the influence of false positive and false negative conclusions about the presence or absence of links in a network on the network topology. We show that different values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links should be used in order to reliably estimate network characteristics. We propose to run careful simulation studies prior to making potentially erroneous conclusion about the network topology.Results: Our analysis shows that optimal values to balance false positive and false negative conclusions about links depend on the network topology and characteristic of interest.Comparison with existing methods: Existing methods rely on a choice of the rate for false positive conclusions. They aim to be sure about individual links rather than the entire network. The rate of false negative conclusions is typically not investigated.Conclusions: Our investigation shows that the balance of false positive and false negative conclusions about links in a network has to be tuned for any network topology that is to be estimated. Moreover, within the same network topology, the results are qualitatively the same for each network characteristic, but the actual values leading to reliable estimates of the characteristics are different.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0165-0270	1872-678X		WOS:000442055800005	29959000	J	Pleuss, James D.; Stamm, Jessica L.

Using Simulated Annealing to Improve the Information Dissemination Network Structure of a Foreign Animal Disease Outbreak Response								JOURNAL OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT				15	3					20170008	10.1515/jhsem-2017-0008					SEP 2018	2018	Communication is an integral part of emergency response, and improving the information dissemination network for crisis communication can save time, resources, and lives. In a foreign animal disease (FAD) outbreak, timeliness of detection and response are critical. An outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, a particularly significant FAD, could cripple the agriculture economy. This research uses communication data from a FAD response exercise in Kansas to develop a reliable crisis communication network model, contributing a general method for creating an information dissemination network from empirical communication data. We then introduce a simulated annealing heuristic that identifies an alternative network structure that minimizes the time for information to reach all response participants. The resultant network structure reduces overall information transmission time by almost 90% and reveals actionable observations for improving FAD response communication. We find that not only can a crisis communication network be improved significantly, but also that the quantitative results support qualitative observations from early in the data extraction process. This paper adds original methods to the literature and opens the door for future quantitative work in the area of crisis communication and emergency response.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2194-6361	1547-7355		WOS:000447974600003		J	Kinne, Brandon J.								Defense Cooperation Agreements and the Emergence of a Global Security Network								INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION				72	4			799	837		10.1017/S0020818318000218					FAL 2018	2018	Bilateral defense cooperation agreements, or DCAs, are now the most common form of institutionalized defense cooperation. These formal agreements establish broad defense-oriented legal frameworks between signatories, facilitating cooperation in such fundamental areas as defense policy coordination, research and development, joint military exercises, education and training, arms procurement, and exchange of classified information. Although nearly a thousand DCAs are currently in force, with potentially wide-ranging impacts on national and international security outcomes, DCAs have been largely ignored by scholars. Why have DCAs proliferated? I develop a theory that integrates cooperation theory with insights from social network analysis. Shifts in the global security environment since the 1980s have fueled demand for DCAs. States use DCAs to modernize their militaries, respond to shared security threats, and establish security umbrellas with like-minded states. Yet, demand alone cannot explain DCA proliferation; to cooperate, governments must also overcome dilemmas of mistrust and distributional conflicts. I show that network influences increase the supply of DCAs by providing governments with information about the trustworthiness of partners and the risk of asymmetric distributions of gains. DCAs become easier to sign as more states sign them. I identify two specific network influencespreferential attachment and triadic closureand show that these influences are largely responsible for the post-Cold War diffusion of DCAs. Novel empirical strategies further indicate that these influences derive from the proposed informational mechanism. States use the DCA ties of others to glean information about prospective defense partners, thus endogenously fueling further growth of the global DCA network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0020-8183	1531-5088		WOS:000447723700002		J	Pablo Cardenas, Juan; Vidal, Gerardo; Urbina, Carolina; Olivares, Gaston; Angel Fuentes, Miguel					Olivares Fernandez, Gaston/0000-0003-3655-7831			Social crises.

The spontaneous increase of complexity of adaptive systems, including social systems, entails critical processes where the organization of the system, or part of it, is questioned. In this study we address the phenomenon of social crises through models of society based in networks that combine the increase in complexity with the clash of forces in conflict which could lead to a crisis for the system. The simulations suggest that there is a positive correlation between the increase in the complexity of the system and the emergence of crises as a complex phenomenon itself where its mitigation can have unexpected results.

Real-world correlated networks are ubiquitous and their topological structure strongly affects the prediction accuracy of present-day theoretical methods. Quantifying their accuracy and fitness in predicting outbreak thresholds of correlated networks is thus essential. We use a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model to examine four widely used theoretical methods - the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF), quenched mean-field (QMF), dynamical message passing (DMP), and connectivity matrix (CM) methods - to predict the outbreak threshold of a correlated network. The potential topological structure of correlated network impacts on prediction accuracy of these four methods. We emphasize that the quantitative changes of degree correlation, degree distribution exponent and network size strongly affect the outbreak of SIR spreading dynamics, and compare the simulation results with the theoretical ones obtained from these four methods. The extensive experiments in synthetic networks show that (a) the increasing degree correlation coefficients reduce outbreak threshold and suppress outbreak size; (b) the increasing degree distribution exponents raise outbreak threshold but suppress outbreak size; (c) the increasing network sizes decrease outbreak threshold but do not affect outbreak size; (d) as for four theoretical methods, CM and DMP are more likely to precisely predict outbreak threshold because they to some extent incorporate network topology with dynamical correlations. The experimental results in 50 real-world networks also prove the above conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many mechanisms that promote cooperation have been proposed within the framework of the evolutionary game theory. Motivated by the fact that people in society or even a certain group are often controlled by a variety of simple rules, we present an external forcing mechanism to analyze the underlying reasons of widespread cooperation in this paper. In detail, we model the agents on a simple regular network, on which the learning method is controlled by external forcing mechanism, and prisoner's dilemma has been applied to describe the interaction of agents. By conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we can easily draw a conclusion that this mechanism can promote cooperation efficiently. In addition, we also show that the proposed mechanism is effective for the cooperation promotion for other game models, such as snowdrift game and multigames. Taken together, the mechanism of external forcing on the evolutionary game is a strong promoter of cooperation even under a severe temptation condition, which has a practical significance and will provide new insight into the analysis and control of cooperative strategy in the complex network for the further research.

Several approaches have been proposed to create procedural stories for games based mainly on logic programming and decision trees. These approaches use a set of possible events that are executed based on how the player interacts with the story. However, these approaches commonly use a fixed set of characters with predefined relationships. In contrast, in this article, we propose an approach that creates dynamic stories based on two networks: a handcrafted event network and a dynamic artificial social network created for each new story. This allows each story to have its own set of characters with a unique relationship network, resulting in an even wider range of possible stories. We demonstrate this with some examples and discuss how this approach can be implemented for interactive computer entertainment systems, such as video games.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1544-3574			WOS:000446002100003		J	Yang, Dong; Chow, Tommy W.

Tremendous evidence in Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and Google+ alike shows that such social networks are the major information sources as well as the most effective platforms for information transmission and exchange. The dynamic propagation of various information may gradually disseminate, drastically increase, strongly compete with each other, or slowly decrease. These observations had led to the present study of the spreading process of true and fake information over social networks, particularly the Facebook. Specifically, in this paper the topological structure of two huge-scale Facebook network datasets are investigated regarding their statistical properties. Based on that, an information model for simulating the true and fake information spreading over the Facebook is established. Through controlling the spreading parameters in extensive large-scale simulations, it is found that the final density of stiflers increases with the growth of the spreading rate, while it would decline with the increase of the removal rate. Moreover, it is found that the spreading process of the truefake information is closely related to the node degrees on the network. Hub-individuals with high degrees have large probabilities to learn hidden information and then spread it. Interestingly, it is found that the spreading rate of the true information but not of the fake information has a great effect on the information spreading process, reflecting the human nature in believing and spreading truths in social activities. The new findings validate the proposed model to be capable of characterizing the dynamic evolution of true and fake information over the Facebook, useful and informative for future social science studies.

The latter arise from their dynamic, inherently volatile nature that tests the resilience of algorithms running on them. Here we consider the deployment of population-based optimization algorithms on such environments, using the island model of memetic algorithms for this purpose. These memetic algorithms are endowed with self-star properties that give them the ability to work autonomously in order to optimize their performance and to react to the instability of computational resources. The main focus of this work is analyzing the performance of these memetic algorithms when the underlying computational substrate is not only volatile but also heterogeneous in terms of the computational power of each of its constituent nodes. To this end, we use a simulated environment that allows experimenting with different volatility rates and heterogeneity scenarios (that is, different distributions of computational power among computing nodes), and we study different strategies for distributing the search among nodes. We observe that the addition of self-scaling and self-healing properties makes the memetic algorithm very robust to both system instability and computational heterogeneity. Additionally, a strategy based on distributing single islands on each computational node is shown to perform globally better than placing many such islands on each of them (either proportionally to their computing power or subject to an intermediate compromise).									2	0	0	0	0	2			1094-3420	1741-2846		WOS:000445237300008		J	Han, Qiyi; Wen, Hong; Miao, Fang								Rumor spreading in interdependent social networks								PEER-TO-PEER NETWORKING AND APPLICATIONS				11	5	SI		955	965		10.1007/s12083-017-0616-y					SEP 2018	2018	Social networks have been witnessed tremendous success and become an indispensable part of people's daily life.

Finally, the impact factors are used to evaluate the reliability of the software system and assess the importance of each component.

To address the deficiencies reported in past studies, an advanced model of coupled electric power system (EPS) and information and communication technology (ICT) is developed. The new model is designed as a 3-D graph with edges and nodes, and it highlights the interaction and interdependency of both EPS and ICT. The criticality of each component within the interconnected system is investigated by analyzing the efficiency-weighted node degree of each node symbolizing the components. The model has been tested on an ICT supported 14-bus distribution network under three different loading conditions. Results show that the coupled infrastructure complies with the typical characteristics of scale-free network. It is also shown the ICT system, although smaller in scale, contains more critical hubs than the power distribution network. The results of the proposed approach can be used as a reference to analyze the criticality in other coupled infrastructure by incorporating the internal characteristics of coupled systems.									4	1	0	0	0	4			1949-3053	1949-3061		WOS:000443200700063		J	Li, Yuanyuan; Lou, Jungang; Wang, Zhen; Alsaadi, Fuad E.

We propose a second-act model that can accurately describe the citation dynamics of second-act articles. The model not only provides a mechanistic framework to understand citation patterns of atypical articles, separating factors that drive impact, but it also offers new capabilities to identify the time of exogenous events that influence citations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2330-1635	2330-1643		WOS:000442990500007		J	Feng, Minyu; Qu, Hong; Yi, Zhang; Kurths, Juergen								Subnormal Distribution Derived From Evolving Networks With Variable Elements								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS				48	9			2556	2568		10.1109/TCYB.2017.2751073					SEP 2018	2018	During the past decades, power-law distributions have played a significant role in analyzing the topology of scale-free networks. However, in the observation of degree distributions in practical networks and other nonuniform distributions such as the wealth distribution, we discover that, there exists a peak at the beginning of most real distributions, which cannot be accurately described by a monotonic decreasing power-law distribution. To better describe the real distributions, in this paper, we propose a subnormal distribution derived from evolving networks with variable elements and study its statistical properties for the first time. By utilizing this distribution, we can precisely describe those distributions commonly existing in the real world, e.g., distributions of degree in social networks and personal wealth. Additionally, we fit connectivity in evolving networks and the data observed in the real world by the proposed subnormal distribution, resulting in a better performance of fitness.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000442362100005	28976328	J	Nazempour, Rezvan; Monfared, Mohammad Ali Saniee; Zio, Enrico								A complex network theory approach for optimizing contamination warning sensor location in water distribution networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION				30		SI		225	234		10.1016/j.ijdrr.2018.04.029					SEP 2018	2018	The goal of sensor placement in water networks is to detect contamination of intentional and accidental events, and to ensure safe and quality drinking water for consumers. Solving this problem as a classical optimization problem has been the focus of attention for many years. This paper presents a new modeling approach by taking into account that a water network is a complex network. Thus, the structural and dynamical complexity properties should play a role in our sensor placement problem. We model the sensor placement problem by a novel integrated approach using both the classical optimization and complex network theory. To test our modeling approach, we have considered a well-known water network with 129 nodes and 178 links which have been researched by about 20 other research groups.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2212-4209			WOS:000441004800008		J	Tang, Yixuan; Wang, Guangbin; Li, Heng; Cao, Dongping				Li, Heng/B-2821-2015	Li, Heng/0000-0002-3187-9041; Cao, Dongping/0000-0002-6366-2621			Dynamics of Collaborative Networks between Contractors and Subcontractors in the Construction Industry: Evidence from National Quality Award Projects in China								JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT				144	9					05018009	10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0001555					SEP 2018	2018	Using the method of stochastic actor-oriented models and a longitudinal data set of the National Quality Award Projects in China during 1998-2017, this study empirically investigates how project-based collaborative networks between contractors and subcontractors in the construction industry evolve across projects, and how related micromechanisms collectively underpin the evolution. The results reveal that the networks become dense over time and exhibit distinct scale-free properties. Furthermore, these macrolevel characteristics of network dynamics significantly relate to the structure-based preferential attachment effect, the ownership similarity effect, the geographic proximity effect, the negative scale similarity effect, and the ownership-based individual covariate effect, which operates at a microlevel. The findings not only provide a network view of how construction organizations select subcontractors in projects, but also contribute to broadened understanding of how project-based collaborative networks among firms in the construction industry evolve as complex adaptive systems whose macrolevel dynamics closely relate to a set of micro-organizing mechanisms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-9364	1943-7862		WOS:000438690000016		J	Dong, Yucheng; Zhan, Min; Kou, Gang; Ding, Zhaogang; Liang, Haiming				Dong, Yucheng/J-1668-2017	Dong, Yucheng/0000-0002-0028-6796			A survey on the fusion process in opinion dynamics								INFORMATION FUSION				43				57	65		10.1016/j.inffus.2017.11.009					SEP 2018	2018	Opinion dynamics is a fusion process of individual opinions, in which a group of interacting agents continuously fuse their opinions on the same issue based on established fusion rules to reach a consensus, polarization, or fragmentation in the final stage. To date, many studies have been conducted on opinion dynamics. To provide a clear perspective on the fusion process in opinion dynamics, this paper presents a review of the framework and formulation of opinion dynamics as well as some basic models, extensions, and applications.

In this letter, we define, for the first time, a remaining minimum degree (RMD) decomposition by removing the node(s) with the minimum degree iteratively. Based on the RMD decomposition, a weighted degree (WD) is presented by utilizing the RMD indices of the nearest neighbors of a node. WD assigns a weight to each degree of this node, which can distinguish the contribution of each degree to the spreading influence. Further, an extended weighted degree (EWD) centrality is proposed by extending the WD of the nearest neighbors of a node. Assuming that the spreading process on networks follows the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model, we perform extensive experiments on a series of synthetic and real networks to comprehensively evaluate the performance of EWD and other eleven representative measures. The experimental results show that EWD is a relatively efficient measure in running efficiency, it exposes an advantage in accuracy in the networks with a relatively small degree heterogeneity, as well as exposes a competitive performance in resolution.

It is a critical procedure for social network topology analysis. In this paper, based on the mean-field theory, we study a special type of social network with exponential distribution of time intervals. First of all, in order to improve the accuracy of analysis, we propose a spreading coefficient algorithm based on intimate relationship, which determines the number of the joined members through the intimacy among members. Then, simulation show that the degree distribution of follows the power-law distribution and has small-world characteristics. Finally, we compare the performance of our algorithm with the existing algorithms, and find that our algorithm improves the accuracy of degree distribution as well as reducing the time complexity significantly, which can complete 29.04% higher precision and 40.94% lower implementation time.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1976-7277			WOS:000445924900006		J	Nicolini, Carlo; Vlasov, Vladimir; Bifone, Angelo								Thermodynamics of network model fitting with spectral entropies								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	2					022322	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.022322					AUG 31 2018	2018	An information-theoretic approach inspired by quantum statistical mechanics was recently proposed as a means to optimize network models and to assess their likelihood against synthetic and real-world networks. Importantly, this method does not rely on specific topological features or network descriptors but leverages entropy-based measures of network distance. Entertaining the analogy with thermodynamics, we provide a physical interpretation of model hyperparameters and propose analytical procedures for their estimate. These results enable the practical application of this novel and powerful framework to network model inference.

In this study, we examine the effects of self-organized interdependence on the evolution and stabilization of cooperation with social dilemmas depicted by the Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) and the Public Goods Game (PGG) in which agents with the most common strategy have the chance to be rewarded proportionally to the fitness of corresponding agents belonging to the other network. We show that such a type-free rewarding rule, independent of game strategy, establishes a time-varying interdependence between two initially independent populations whereby cooperation is highly promoted as well as stabilized both in the two-player PDG and in the multi-player PGG. Majority-pressure based interdependence at stake has proven pretty neutral in regard to game strategy because it is contingent on strategy configuration rather than strategy itself, which thus gives birth to homologous communities, including cooperative as well as non-cooperative, and thereby an enhanced spatial reciprocity between non-identical networks is triggered. Of particular interest is the double-edged sword effect of network interdependence on cooperation although in most instances the heavier the interdependence, the better the evolution of cooperation. Furthermore, interpretations of the nontrivial relationship between cooperation and benchmark threshold measuring the strategy's local popularity highlight that rewarding the minimum majority is optimal for the evolution of cooperation in such scenario. Finally, we claim our observations are also quite robust with respect to mutation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000443327900003		J	Wang, Xin; Chen, Feng; Zhang, Tao; Qin, Ning; Jiang, Zhong-Yuan				Jiang, Zhong-Yuan/B-3847-2012	Jiang, Zhong-Yuan/0000-0001-8249-9711			A new routing strategy limited by heterogeneous link bandwidth								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	24					1850292	10.1142/S0217984918502925					AUG 30 2018	2018	Traffic capacity of a network is very vital to a variety of complex networks, such as communication networks and road networks, in which the bandwidth of every link is limited or finite. In this work, inspired by the deployment process of nodes and links in real networks, we assume the bandwidth of every link is composed of a constant part and a degree-related one that can be updated iteratively with the network hardware update. We propose a link bandwidth-based routing mechanism to enhance the network traffic capacity. Extensive simulations in both scale-free networks and random networks are done to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. Comparing results with the shortest path routing and a weighted routing, our method achieves better network traffic capacity among all used routing strategies without obvious extra cost including the network diameter, average path length and average packet traveling time. Our work studies network routing from a very new perspective and might have potential applications in real network systems such as the communication networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000442947300014		J	Nokkala, Johannes; Maniscalco, Sabrina; Piilo, Jyrki				Maniscalco, Sabrina/Q-1043-2015; Piilo, Jyrki/D-3043-2011	Maniscalco, Sabrina/0000-0001-8559-0828; Piilo, Jyrki/0000-0002-5595-873X; Nokkala, Johannes/0000-0002-5052-9813			Local probe for connectivity and coupling strength in quantum complex networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						13010	10.1038/s41598-018-30863-2					AUG 29 2018	2018	We develop a local probe to estimate the connectivity of complex quantum networks. Our results show how global properties of different classes of complex networks can be estimated - in quantitative manner with high accuracy - by coupling a probe to a single node of the network. Here, our interest is focused on probing the connectivity, i.e. the degree sequence, and the value of the coupling constant within the complex network. The scheme combines results on classical graph theory with the ability to develop quantum probes for networks of quantum harmonic oscillators. Whilst our results are proof-of-principle type, within the emerging field of quantum complex networks they may have potential applications for example to the efficient transfer of quantum information or energy or possibly to shed light on the connection between network structure and dynamics.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000443003800017	30158659	J	Sadri, Arif Mohaimin; Hasan, Samiul; Ukkusuri, Satish V.; Suarez Lopez, Juan Esteban								Analysis of social interaction network properties and growth on Twitter								SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING				8	1					56	10.1007/s13278-018-0533-y					AUG 29 2018	2018	The complex topology of real networks allows its actors to change their functional behavior. Network models provide better understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms being accountable for the growth of such networks by capturing the dynamics in the ways network agents interact and change their behavior. Considerable amount of research efforts is required for developing novel network modeling techniques to understand the structural properties of such networks, reproducing similar properties based on empirical evidence, and designing such networks efficiently. In this study, we first demonstrate how to construct social interaction networks using social media data and then present the key findings obtained from the network analytics. We analyze the characteristics and growth of online social interaction networks, examine the network properties and derive important insights based on the theories of network science literature. We observed that the degree distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of the existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions, and many other nodes with less interaction. While the network elements and average user degree grow linearly each day, densities of such networks tend to become zero. Largest connected components exhibit higher connectivity (density) when compared with the whole graph. Network radius and diameter become stable over time evidencing the small-world property. We also observe increased transitivity and higher stability of the power-law exponents as the networks grow. Since the data is specific to the Purdue University community, we also observe two very big events, namely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue University as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016. The social interaction network properties that are revealed in this study can be useful in disseminating targeted information during planned special events.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000443060200001		J	Emilsson, Valur; Ilkov, Marjan; Lamb, John R.; Finkel, Nancy; Gudmundsson, Elias F.; Pitts, Rebecca; Hoover, Heather; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg; Horman, Shane R.; Aspelund, Thor; Shu, Le; Trifonov, Vladimir; Sigurdsson, Sigurdur; Manolescu, Andrei; Zhu, Jun; Olafsson, Orn; Jakobsdottir, Johanna; Lesley, Scott A.; To, Jeremy; Zhang, Jia; Harris, Tamara B.; Launer, Lenore J.; Zhang, Bin; Eiriksdottir, Gudny; Yang, Xia; Orth, Anthony P.; Jennings, Lori L.; Gudnason, Vilmundur				Aspelund, Thor/K-7022-2019; Manolescu, Andrei/G-4565-2014; Jennings, Lori/R-7152-2019	Aspelund, Thor/0000-0002-7998-5433; Manolescu, Andrei/0000-0002-0713-4664; Emilsson, Valur/0000-0001-9982-0524; Gudmundsdottir, Valborg/0000-0002-7459-1603; Gudmundsson, Elias Freyr/0000-0002-7661-4872			Co-regulatory networks of human serum proteins link genetics to disease								SCIENCE				361	6404			769	773		10.1126/science.aaq1327					AUG 24 2018	2018	Proteins circulating in the blood are critical for age-related disease processes; however, the serum proteome has remained largely unexplored. To this end, 4137 proteins covering most predicted extracellular proteins were measured in the serum of 5457 Icelanders over 65 years of age. Pairwise correlation between proteins as they varied across individuals revealed 27 different network modules of serum proteins, many of which were associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disease states, as well as overall survival. The protein modules were controlled by cis- and trans-acting genetic variants, which in many cases were also associated with complex disease. This revealed co-regulated groups of circulating proteins that incorporated regulatory control between tissues and demonstrated close relationships to past, current, and future disease states.									8	0	0	5	0	8			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000442828700037	30072576	J	Choi, Jaejoon; Lee, Doheon				Lee, Doheon/B-7303-2011	Lee, Doheon/0000-0001-9070-4316			Topological motifs populate complex networks through grouped attachment								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						12670	10.1038/s41598-018-30845-4					AUG 23 2018	2018	Network motifs are topological subgraph patterns that recur with statistical significance in a network. Network motifs have been widely utilized to represent important topological features for analyzing the functional properties of complex networks. While recent studies have shown the importance of network motifs, existing network models are not capable of reproducing real-world topological properties of network motifs, such as the frequency of network motifs and relative graphlet frequency distances. Here, we propose a new network measure and a new network model to reconstruct real-world network topologies, by incorporating our Grouped Attachment algorithm to generate networks in which closely related nodes have similar edge connections. We applied the proposed model to real-world complex networks, and the resulting constructed networks more closely reflected real-world network motif properties than did the existing models that we tested: the Erdos-Renyi, small-world, scale-free, popularity-similarity-optimization, and nonuniform popularity-similarity-optimization models. Furthermore, we adapted the preferential attachment algorithm to our model to gain scale-free properties while preserving motif properties. Our findings show that grouped attachment is one possible mechanism to reproduce network motif recurrence in real-world complex networks.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000442530000034	30140017	J	Zhu, Fei; Cizeron, Melissa; Qiu, Zhen; Benavides-Piccione, Ruth; Kopanitsa, Maksym V.; Skene, Nathan G.; Koniaris, Babis; DeFelipe, Javier; Fransen, Erik; Komiyama, Noboru H.; Grant, Seth G.

We developed genetic labeling and imaging methods to examine synaptic proteins in individual excitatory synapses across all regions of the mouse brain. Synapse catalogs were generated from the molecular and morphological features of a billion synapses. Each synapse subtype showed a unique anatomical distribution, and each brain region showed a distinct signature of synapse subtypes. Whole-brain synaptome cartography revealed spatial architecture from dendritic to global systems levels and previously unknown anatomical features. Synaptome mapping of circuits showed correspondence between synapse diversity and structural and functional connectomes. Behaviorally relevant patterns of neuronal activity trigger spatio-temporal postsynaptic responses sensitive to the structure of synaptome maps. Areas controlling higher cognitive function contain the greatest synapse diversity, and mutations causing cognitive disorders reorganized synaptome maps. Synaptome technology and resources have wide-ranging application in studies of the normal and diseased brain.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0896-6273	1097-4199		WOS:000442351600015	30078578	J	Gu, Shawn; Johnson, John; Faisal, Fazle E.; Milenkovic, Tijana								From homogeneous to heterogeneous network alignment via colored graphlets								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						12524	10.1038/s41598-018-30831-w					AUG 21 2018	2018	Network alignment (NA) compares networks with the goal of finding a node mapping that uncovers highly similar (conserved) network regions. Existing NA methods are homogeneous, i.e., they can deal only with networks containing nodes and edges of one type. Due to increasing amounts of heterogeneous network data with nodes or edges of different types, we extend three recent state-of-the-art homogeneous NA methods, WAVE, MAGNA++, and SANA, to allow for heterogeneous NA for the first time. We introduce several algorithmic novelties. Namely, these existing methods compute homogeneous graphlet-based node similarities and then find high-scoring alignments with respect to these similarities, while simultaneously maximizing the amount of conserved edges. Instead, we extend homogeneous graphlets to their heterogeneous counterparts, which we then use to develop a new measure of heterogeneous node similarity. Also, we extend S-3, a state-of-the-art measure of edge conservation for homogeneous NA, to its heterogeneous counterpart. Then, we find high-scoring alignments with respect to our heterogeneous node similarity and edge conservation measures. In evaluations on synthetic and real-world biological networks, our proposed heterogeneous NA methods lead to higher-quality alignments and better robustness to noise in the data than their homogeneous counterparts.

Varying the internal control parameter, one can explain interesting universality classes for avalanche-type events. We also discuss different versions of the model.

In this paper, we develop a new representation model for BTNs using double edge weights and node weights, namely perfect space P. The model incorporates the number and lengths of directed routes between the two stations and the number of routes that connect to each station. Based on the model, we develop an empirical study on four large BTNs in Northeast China. Some common network characteristics of the BTNs are revealed and discussed in detail. The results show that several empirical distributions follow an exponential law. Moreover, the unweighted path length distributions can be fitted by a Gaussian function, while the weighted path length distributions can be fitted by a composite Gaussian function. Specifically, we introduce the weighted-degree distribution with different lengths and the special edge weight distribution, given the new evidence for the random behavior during the expansion of BTNs, including new stations and routes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000440827700010		J	Rungta, Pranay Deep; Meena, Chandrakala; Sinha, Sudeshna								Identifying nodal properties that are crucial for the dynamical robustness of multistable networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	2					022314	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.022314					AUG 17 2018	2018	We investigate the collective dynamics of bistable elements connected in different network topologies and estimate the network response to localized perturbations on different classes of nodes by introducing a variant of the concept of multinode basin stability. We show that perturbations on nodes with high closeness and betweeness centrality drastically reduces the capacity of the system to return to the original state. This effect is most pronounced for a star network, where perturbation of the single hub node can destroy the collective state, while the system manages to recover even when a majority of the peripheral nodes are strongly perturbed. This demonstrates the extreme effect of the centrality of the perturbed node on the stability of the network. Further, we exploit the difference in centrality distributions in random scale-free networks with m = 1 and m = 2 to probe which property most influences the collective dynamics in heterogeneous networks. Significantly, we find clear evidence that the betweeness centrality of the perturbed node is more crucial for dynamical robustness than closeness centrality or degree of the node. This allows us to decide which nodes to safeguard in order to maintain the collective state of a network against targeted localized attacks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000442081500002	30253521	J	Toscani, Giuseppe; Tosin, Andrea; Zanella, Mattia				Zanella, Mattia/E-4181-2015; Zanella, Mattia/U-7517-2017; Tosin, Andrea/E-5737-2012; Toscani, Giuseppe/R-5389-2019	Zanella, Mattia/0000-0001-8456-5866; Zanella, Mattia/0000-0001-8456-5866; Tosin, Andrea/0000-0003-4955-1818; Toscani, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4419-804X			Opinion modeling on social media and marketing aspects								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	2					022315	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.022315					AUG 17 2018	2018	We introduce and discuss kinetic models of opinion formation on social networks in which the distribution function depends on both the opinion and the connectivity of the agents.

Farey graphs are therefore famous in deterministic models for complex networks. By lacking of the most important characteristics of scale-free, Farey graphs are not a good model for networks associated with some empirical complex systems. We discuss here a category of graphs which are extension of the well-known Farey graphs. These new models are named generalized Farey graphs here. We focus on the analysis of the topological characteristics of the new models and deduce the complicated and graceful analytical results from the growth mechanism used in generalized Farey graphs. The conclusions show that the new models not only possess the properties of being small-world and highly clustered, but also possess the quality of being scale-free. We also find that it is precisely because of the exponential increase of nodes' degrees in generalized Farey graphs as they grow that caused the new networks to have scale-free characteristics. In contrast, the linear incrementation of nodes' degrees in Farey graphs can only cause an exponential degree distribution.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000441625500017	30111775	J	Li, Rongpeng; Zhao, Zhifeng; Yang, Chenyang; Wu, Chunming; Zhang, Honggang								Wireless big data in cellular networks: the cornerstone of smart cities								IET COMMUNICATIONS				12	13			1517	1523		10.1049/iet-com.2017.1278					AUG 14 2018	2018	The rapid urbanisation has transformed cities to the preferential human settlement and allowed cities to quietly witness all range of human activities. As the key enabler in the information and communications technology industry, cellular networks play a decisive role in delivering communication messages and entertainment content. In particular, cellular network operators respond to human initiated service requests by gradually deploying necessary infrastructure and calibrating transmission protocols. Hence, cellular network records encompass the interesting interaction between human-initiated messages and network-triggered responses. In this study, the authors collect the big data' in urban cellular networks and try to dig out the human and urban planning properties. Specifically, they focus on the statistical modelling of three representative scenarios like spatial deployment density of base stations, packet length or traffic volume of mobile services, as well as inter-arrival time and dwell time of human mobility. Through extensive data mining, they validate the heavy-tailed feature universally existing in these scenarios. Afterwards, they discuss the implications of this heavy-tailed feature and talk about its fundamental contribution to intelligent resource adjustment, proactive content caching, and enhanced connection management in cellular networks. Finally, they highlight the applications of this feature towards smarter cellular networks and cities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8628	1751-8636		WOS:000441140700001		J	Ahajjam, Sara; Badir, Hassan				Hassan, BADIR/R-6226-2019				Identification of influential spreaders in complex networks using HybridRank algorithm								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						11932	10.1038/s41598-018-30310-2					AUG 9 2018	2018	Identifying the influential spreaders in complex networks is crucial to understand who is responsible for the spreading processes and the influence maximization through networks. Targeting these influential spreaders is significant for designing strategies for accelerating the propagation of information that is useful for various applications, such as viral marketing applications or blocking the diffusion of annoying information (spreading of viruses, rumors, online negative behaviors, and cyberbullying). Existing methods such as local centrality measures like degree centrality are less effective, and global measures like closeness and betweenness centrality could better identify influential spreaders but they have some limitations. In this paper, we propose the HybridRank algorithm using a new hybrid centrality measure for detecting a set of influential spreaders using the topological features of the network. We use the SIR spreading model for simulating the spreading processes in networks to evaluate the performance of our algorithm. Empirical experiments are conducted on real and artificial networks, and the results show that the spreaders identified by our approach are more influential than several benchmarks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000441159800038	30093716	J	Verma, Prateek; Nandi, Anjan K.; Sengupta, Supratim					Verma, Prateek/0000-0003-3431-246X			Bribery games on interdependent complex networks								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				450				43	52		10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.04.028					AUG 7 2018	2018	Bribe demands present a social conflict scenario where decisions have wide-ranging economic and ethical consequences. Nevertheless, such incidents occur daily in many countries across the globe. Harassment bribery constitute a significant sub-set of such bribery incidents where a government official demands a bribe for providing a service to a citizen legally entitled to it. We employ an evolutionary game-theoretic framework to analyse the evolution of corrupt and honest strategies in structured populations characterized by an interdependent complex network. The effects of changing network topology, average number of links and asymmetry in size of the citizen and officer population on the proliferation of incidents of bribery are explored. A complex network topology is found to be beneficial for the dominance of corrupt strategies over a larger region of phase space when compared with the outcome for a regular network, for equal citizen and officer population sizes. However, the extent of the advantage depends critically on the network degree and topology. A different trend is observed when there is a difference between the citizen and officer population sizes. Under those circumstances, increasing randomness of the underlying citizen network can be beneficial to the fixation of honest officers up to a certain value of the network degree. Our analysis reveals how the interplay between network topology, connectivity and strategy update rules can affect population level outcomes in such asymmetric games. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate that paths, particularly the shortest ones, are incomplete in information network. However, based on such paths, many network centrality measures are designed. While extensive explorations on paths have been made, modest studies focus on the cycles on measuring network centrality. We study the relationship between the shortest cycle and the shortest path from extensive real-world networks. The results illustrate the incompleteness of the shortest paths on measuring network centrality. Noticing that the shortest cycle is much more robust than the shortest path, we propose two novel cycle-based network centrality measures to address the incompleteness of paths: the shortest cycle closeness centrality (SCC) and the all cycle betweenness centrality (ACC). Notwithstanding we focus on the network centrality problem, our findings on cycles can be applied to explain the incompleteness of paths in applications and could improve the applicability into more scenarios where the paths are employed in network science.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000440782000036	30082835	J	Moinet, Antoine; Barrat, Alain; Pastor-Satorras, Romualdo								Generalized voterlike model on activity-driven networks with attractiveness								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	2					022303	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.022303					AUG 6 2018	2018	We study the behavior of a generalized consensus dynamics on a temporal network of interactions, the activitydriven network with attractiveness. In this temporal network model, agents are endowed with an intrinsic activity a, ruling the rate at which they generate connections, and an intrinsic attractiveness b, modulating the rate at which they receive connections. The consensus dynamics considered is a mixed voter and Moran dynamics. Each agent, either in state 0 or 1, modifies his or her state when connecting with a peer. Thus, an active agent copies his or her state from the peer (with probability p) or imposes his or her state to him or her (with the complementary probability 1 -p). Applying a heterogeneous mean-field approach, we derive a differential equation for the average density of voters with activity a and attractiveness b in state 1, which we use to evaluate the average time to reach consensus and the exit probability, defined as the probability that a single agent with activity a and attractiveness b eventually imposes his or her state to a pool of initially unanimous population in the opposite state. We study a number of particular cases, finding an excellent agreement with numerical simulations of the model. Interestingly, we observe a symmetry between voter and Moran dynamics in pure activity-driven networks and their static integrated counterparts that exemplifies the strong differences that a time-varying network can impose on dynamical processes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000440825800005	30253553	J	Banerjee, Anubhab; Banerjee, Bitan; Seetharam, Anand; Tellambura, Chintha					Seetharam, Anand/0000-0003-4559-7886			Content search and routing under custodian unavailability in information-centric networks								COMPUTER NETWORKS				141				92	101		10.1016/j.comnet.2018.05.015					AUG 4 2018	2018	Dealing with the sudden unavailability of content custodians (origin servers) in a network has received limited attention in information-centric networks (ICN). We consider a scenario where the content custodians in an ICN are temporarily unavailable, possibly due to reasons such as device malfunctioning, power outage or Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. In contrast to the traditional host-centric Internet, users can still be served in an ICN as content is cached at in-network nodes. We begin by making the observation that if caches continue to operate using their native cache insertion and eviction policies after the content custodians become unavailable, over time the network content diversity decreases. Therefore, we recommend freezing network caches once the custodians become unavailable. We then propose a routing and search algorithm, Content Exploration under Server Unavailability (CESU), that uses breadcrumbs to effectively locate content cached at in-network nodes and serve user requests when the custodians are unavailable. We perform extensive simulations on real Internet topologies in the Icarus simulator and demonstrate that CESU can efficiently locate content cached in the network. CESU outperforms shortest path routing in terms of content requests served by 56% on average, and achieves up to 98.5% of the total request serving potential. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

P v. Lett. 118, 238301 (2017)], in which each Kuramoto oscillator can decide whether to interact or not with its neighbors, and all oscillators can receive some benefits from the local synchronization, but those who choose to interact must pay a cost. Oscillators are allowed to update their strategies according to payoff difference, wherein the strategy of an oscillator who has obtained higher payoff is more likely to be followed. Utilizing this coevolutionary model, we find that the global synchronization level reaches the highest level when the average degree of the underlying interaction network is moderate. We also study how synchronization is affected by the individual rationality in choosing strategy.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000440634800002	30253547	J	How, Javier J.; Navlakha, Saket								Evidence of Rentian Scaling of Functional Modules in Diverse Biological Networks								NEURAL COMPUTATION				30	8			2210	2244		10.1162/neco_a_01095					AUG 2018	2018	Biological networks have long been known to be modular, containing sets of nodes that are highly connected internally. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on understanding how intermodule connections are distributed within a network. Here, we borrow ideas from engineered circuit design and study Rentian scaling, which states that the number of external connections between nodes in different modules is related to the number of nodes inside the modules by a power-law relationship. We tested this property in a broad class of molecular networks, including protein interaction networks for six species and gene regulatory networks for 41 human and 25 mouse cell types. Using evolutionarily defined modules corresponding to known biological processes in the cell, we found that all networks displayed Rentian scaling with a broad range of exponents. We also found evidence for Rentian scaling in functional modules in the Caenorhabditis elegans neural network, but, interestingly, not in three different social networks, suggesting that this property does not inevitably emerge. To understand how such scaling may have arisen evolutionarily, we derived a new graph model that can generate Rentian networks given a target Rent exponent and a module decomposition as inputs. Overall, our work uncovers a new principle shared by engineered circuits and biological networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0899-7667	1530-888X		WOS:000445128000005	29894651	J	He, Jia; Xue, Yumei								Scale-free and small-world properties of hollow cube networks								CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				113				11	15		10.1016/j.chaos.2018.04.024					AUG 2018	2018	In this paper, we construct the evolving networks from hollow cube in fractal geometry by encoding.

Various analyses have revealed self-similarity in particle production process. The concept of self-similarity is indicative of fractal geometry. The present analysis reports an exhaustive study on centrality dependence of event-by-event fluctuation of pions produced in O-16-AgBr interactions at 60 A GeV using a non conventional tool based on complex network analysis, viz. visibility graph method. The analysis reveals different fractal behaviour as well as different clustering property for different centrality events and the amount of fractality and average clustering coefficient decrease with the increase of centrality. Estimation of Hurst exponent hints towards two different sources of fluctuation, fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and fractional Gaussian noises (fGn) for two different centrality classes.

Financial stocks generate a significant amount of multivariate time series data that can be used to build networks that reflect market behavior. However, traditional commercial complex networks cannot fully utilize the multiple attributes of stocks and redundant filter relationships and reveal a more authentic financial stock market. We propose a fusion similarity of multiple time series and construct a threshold network with similarity. Furthermore, we define the connectivity efficiency to choose the best threshold, establishing a high connectivity efficiency network with the optimal network threshold. By searching the central node in the threshold network, we have found that the network center nodes constructed by our proposed method have a more comprehensive industry coverage than the traditional techniques to build the systems, and this also proves the superiority of this method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2078-2489			WOS:000443255500019		J	Ruiz, Diego; Finke, Jorge					RUIZ, DIEGO/0000-0001-8198-2912			Lyapunov-Based Anomaly Detection in Highly-Clustered Networks								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS				172	4			1127	1146		10.1007/s10955-018-2089-7					AUG 2018	2018	Network formation models explain the dynamics of the structure of connections using mechanisms that operate under different principles for establishing and removing edges. The Jackson-Rogers model is a generic framework that applies the principle of triadic closure to networks that grow by the addition of new nodes and new edges over time. Past work describes the limit distribution of the in-degree of the nodes based on a continuous-time approximation. Here, we introduce a discrete-time approach of the dynamics of the in- and out-degree distributions of a variation of the model. Furthermore, we characterize the limit distributions and the expected value of the average degree as equilibria, and prove that the equilibria are asymptotically stable. Finally, we use the stability properties of the model to propose a detection criterion for anomalies in the edge formation process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4715	1572-9613		WOS:000439748800009		J	Li, Gang; Li, Bo; Jiang, Yonghua; Jiao, Weidong; Lan, Hu; Zhu, Chungeng								A new method for automatically modelling brain functional networks								BIOMEDICAL SIGNAL PROCESSING AND CONTROL				45				70	79		10.1016/j.bspc.2018.05.024					AUG 2018	2018	Traditional methods for constructing brain functional network often need to artificially set a certain threshold, which requires professional and technical personnel to do this work. In order to overcome this deficiency, this study proposed a new method that can automatically construct brain functional network from electroencephalogram (EEG) data, based on positional relations among the vertices and network motif theories. To verify this method, resting state and task state EEG data were converted into brain functional networks with both the new method and traditional methods to explore the discrepancies of network features. The results showed that the mean physical distance increased with the increasing of network edges, evidently suggesting that higher weights of the edges have shorter physical distances, which is the direct model foundation. Besides, consistent results of network features were obtained among these methods, especially in weighted networks, indicating that this new method had the same capacity in accurately characterizing network features compared with the traditional methods. Moreover, this new method can efficiently distinguish the networks that have big differences in the weights, if the network has higher weights, the corresponding network would have more edges, which is in line with one of the traditional methods that using a threshold of weight. We also applied this model in mental fatigue detection, and the results of network characteristics, which obtained from the model and traditional method, have the same variation tendency, approximate values, and similar statistical differences, demonstrating that the proposed model can replace the traditional methods in differentiating similar brain functional states. The new method have potential applications in real-time brain functional networks construction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The method is validated by means of realistic simulations of large-scale neuronal populations. New results related to functional connectivity estimation and network topology identification obtained by experimental electrophysiological recordings from high-density and large-scale (i.e., 4096 electrodes) microtransducer arrays coupled to in vitro neural populations are presented. Specifically, we show that: (i) functional inhibitory connections are accurately identified in in vitro cortical networks, providing that a reasonable firing rate and recording length are achieved; (ii) small-world topology, with scale-free and rich-club features are reliably obtained, on condition that a minimum number of active recording sites are available.

We also need decision support tools that help incorporate such indicators into policy analysis. Drawing inspiration from urban studies and ecology, in this paper we develop a scaling indicator for income disparity in national economies that is a measure of system complexity and does not presuppose any distribution as ideal. The scaling indicator is calculated for 2010 income distribution data for countries. We show that rising disparity - measured using this indicator calculated; a) for distributions of incomes across consecutive twentieth percentiles of population in national economies and; b), for distributions of population density in census blocks in metropolitan statistical areas affects energy consumption efficiency in a diametrically different manner in cities and nation states leading to a higher urban carbon footprint while increasing energy efficiency nationally. The different nature of these two systems explains the results. We then modify tools for visualizing complexity from urban studies and ecology to explore the correlation between income disparity and energy efficiency in national economies.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2214-6296	2214-6326		WOS:000439444400024		J	Wen, Xiangxi; Tu, Congliang; Wu, Minggong								Node importance evaluation in aviation network based on "No Return" node deletion method								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				503				546	559		10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.109					AUG 1 2018	2018	Node importance evaluation is of great importance in the defense and attack of aviation network, most current studies did not consider the dynamic change and specific characteristics of aviation network. On the basis of complex network theory and node deletion method, a method customized for node importance evaluation in aviation network was proposed. The main feature of the method proposed is that the node will not be returned to the network after being removed, so it is called NR method, short for "No Return". Network efficiency, largest component size and network flow were used as the indicators of network performance. In order to quantify the three indicators, multi-attribute decision-making method was introduced, which takes individual network removed of different nodes as a solution, takes the evaluation indicators of network as the attributes of each solution. To demonstrate the method proposed, a randomly generated network, Chinese aviation network and American aviation network were chosen as test beds. The experiments' results show that NR method is more comprehensive and accurate than other method based on single metric (e.g. K-shell and closeness method). Compared with R-strategy, NR method shows its accuracy, some potential key nodes can be discovered along with nodes deletion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies showed that the degree centrality and the coreness centrality can effectively evaluate the spreading capability of nodes. However, specific network topologies significantly decrease the effectiveness of these two metrics. In this paper, we propose a new method called LS method. The LS method distinguishes the importance of the different edges of the node during the spreading process and figures out a new way to rank the spreading capability of nodes. Simulation experiments on real networks show that the proposed method is more efficient and more versatile than the degree centrality and the k-shell decomposition algorithms. Unlike other improved methods, the LS method does not need to compute any empirical parameter, which means the LS method is more efficient than these improved methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

With no doubt it is of great significance to promote the anti-attack ability of systems. Besides, analyzing attack models is also of significance. The existing studies about network robustness conducted on weighted or unweighted networks have drawn the conclusion that scale-free networks are fragile under malicious attacks, where the precondition is that the cost of removing a node is equal. In fact, the cost of attacking different nodes is far from equal, thus, the removal cost should be taken into consideration when conducting attacks. In this paper, a malicious attack model considering the cost of attacking nodes, termed as Nodal Attack with Cost (NA(C)), is first proposed to depict the tolerance of networks. Furthermore, the limitation of resources drives us to design an optimization algorithm based on memetic algorithm (MA), termed as MA-NA(C), to search for the optimal combination of nodes with the minimum cost which can destroy networks to the desired degree. The experimental results show that networks perform robust under the high degree adaptive (HDA) attack when there is a great difference between hub nodes and leaf nodes in the attack cost, yet the results are similar to previous studies on the condition that the attack cost gap is minor. In addition, MA-NA(C) is efficient in finding a relatively small attack cost. Based on the study of cost-optimized network structure and features of attacked nodes obtained by MA-NA(C), we find that MA-NA(C) selects the target nodes by taking into account their effect on network structure, which contributes to the good optimization ability of MA-NA(C).

The selection of subsidized individuals in proposed policies, such as random subsidy (RAN) and target subsidy (TAR), do nor always consider an individual's history of vaccination behaviors. In this paper, we studied a seasonal influenza-like disease model and proposed two history information-based subsidy policies in which individuals are selected as donees based on vaccination information in the previous seasons: HI-RAN randomly selects individuals who did not voluntarily vaccinate in the previous season, and HI-TAR combines the degree centrality on this basis. Simulations in different networks show that the two proposed subsidy policies both limit the extent of an epidemic outbreak, and the HI-TAR policy is more effective. Moreover, both of our proposed policies are most effective when only one step history information is considered.

Without considering the network structure, the performance of these algorithms is limited. Therefore, we put forward a way for classifying the edges of networks into three types, which are valid edges, invalid edges and flexible edges. Then, a heuristic optimization algorithm, which is designed based on the edge classification (EC) against malicious attacks (MA), is proposed to improve the robustness of scale-free (RSF) network termed as EC-RSFMA. EC-RSFMA improves the robustness of scale-free networks by adjusting the number of edges of each type and changing the connection relation of the same type of edges under the constraint that the degree distribution remains to be unchanged. In the experiments, the performance of EC-RSFMA is validated on both synthetic and real-world networks. The results show that EC-RSFMA outperforms the existing algorithms. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we introduce neutral punishment, which is executed only if personal payoff is less than the average payoff of neighbors, into spatial prisoner's dilemma game. In addition, we consider memory length to control the time span of recovery. It is shown that cooperative behavior is remarkably promoted and even dominant with increment of punishment rate and memory length in spite of the high value of temptation. Moreover, we draw a conclusion that this facilitation phenomenon of cooperation is due to heterogeneity of individual fitness coefficient, thus verifying the positive effect of heterogeneity on the evolution of cooperation through network reciprocity.

The quantitative research method is applied to examine, the network centrality, network accessibility and network community partition focusing on the upper-layer (rail network) network growth process. We based on the case study of Kuala Lumpur and found that when a rail network grows with a simple tree-like network to a more intricate form, the network diameter and the average shortest path length of multi-layer networks decrease dramatically. The network expansion ability keeps changing and more rail stations in the city centre have higher ability for future expansion. Changes in betweenness centrality and closeness centrality of multi-layer networks essentially hinge on the growth of rail network, with the highest change rate of closeness centrality at around 211.48%. The growth of network allows the remainder of the network to be easily visited, with the highest change rate of network accessibility around 12%. Different performances of these nodes added in the multi-layer network are discussed to show their impact on the repartition of network communities and the number of communities is decreasing. We believe this research can benefit scholars to easily understand and apply these network dynamic computational techniques. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The communities detection had been solved by Harary and Davis when a signed graph is balanced or weak balanced. While communities detection become much complex when a signed network is imbalanced. In this paper, a novel evolution algorithm is presented on community detection in imbalanced signed networks which can be modeled as an optimal partition problem. And the evolving mechanism of nodes is updated by its neighbors' information which leads to form optimal community structure. The effectiveness of the algorithm is proved by experiments both on real-world and synthetic networks. The comparison with other algorithms by some parameters showed that the evolution algorithm is effective and accurate. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In social networks, the dynamical propagation of different information often exhibits different dynamical behaviors. And different information may even compete with each other that can determine the dynamical process of information dissemination. These phenomena have led to the present study on the spreading process of competitive information over social networks. In this study, we proposed a competitive information model over the multiplex networks. The simulations of this model are verified by two types of the multiplex networks, such as the real composite network and the artificial composite network. Through controlling the spreading parameters in extensive large-scale simulations, it is found that the final density of stiflers increases with the growth of the spreading rate, while it declines with the increasing of the removal rate. It is also found that the spreading process of the competitive information is closely related to the node degrees on multiplex networks. Through controlling the exchanging rate of competitive information, we are able to determine information dominance accurately. Our new findings validate that the proposed model is capable of characterizing the dynamic evolution of competitive information over multiplex social networks. The results of this study are significant to the study of social science and social platform behavior. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Through analyzing the network's topological structure, we obtain the characteristics of the transitions of these states in financial time series. The results show that nodes' out-strength distribution and betweenness centrality distribution both follow the power-law distribution. A shock to one financial market can be quickly transited to the other three financial markets and a transition probability matrix is proposed to predict the short-term financial market fluctuations. The transition characteristics under volatility clustering of the network that are obtained in this study provide a new perspective to explain financial volatility clustering, which extends the application of complex network theory to financial studies and helps investors understand the financial market.

Best-First search (BFS) and Depth-First search (DFS) are two main search strategies used for search-based complete DCOP algorithms. Unfortunately, BFS often has to deal with a large number of solution reconstructions whereas DFS is unable to promptly prune sub-optimal branch. However, their weaknesses will be remedied if the two search strategies are combined based on agents' positions in a pseudo-tree. Therefore, a hybrid DCOP algorithm with the combination of BFS and DFS, called BD-ADOPT, is proposed, in which a layering boundary is introduced to divide all agents into BFS-based agents and DFS-based agents. Furthermore, this paper gives a rule to find a suitable layering boundary with a new strategy for the agents near the boundary to realize the seamless joint between BFS and DFS strategies. Detailed experimental results show that BD-ADOPT outperforms some famous search-based complete DCOP algorithms on the benchmark problems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0269-2821	1573-7462		WOS:000438654200001		J	Ding, Chao; Yao, Hong; Du, Jun; Peng, Xing Zhao								Load-induced cascading failures in interconnected network systems								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	8					1850073	10.1142/S0129183118500730					AUG 2018	2018	Revealing how the interdependency between different networks affects the load-induced cascading failures is a new interesting topic recently. A new cascading failure model for interconnected network system is introduced in this paper, in which the loads of the failed nodes can be transmitted between different layer networks or among each layer network, the ratio is adjusted with a defined parameter T-f which can be viewed as a measure of coupling strength. Based on the proposed model, we find that under different attacking strategies and different value of T-f, different coupling types have different effects on the robustness of interconnected network systems. We mainly focus on the robustness of interconnected network with random coupling under intentional attack, we find there being a threshold T*(f), when T-f < T*(f), the interconnected network systems will be more vulnerable with larger value of T-f ; however, when T-f > T*(f), if the capacity redundancy of interconnected network is low, increasing T-f tends to enhance the robustness of interconnected network system. In addition, we also get the conclusion that increasing the total amount of loads in one layer network or the unbalance of load distribution between different layer networks will decline the robustness of the interconnected network system. We hope our work will shed some light on designing high-robust interconnected network systems or improving the robustness of interconnected network systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443597700011		J	Morrison, Greg; Dudte, Levi H.; Mahadevan, L.

This includes the identification of globally central nodes and analysing the importance of pairwise relationships between nodes. In this paper, we consider the concept of topological proximity (or 'closeness') between nodes in a weighted network using the generalized Erdos numbers (GENs). This measure satisfies a number of desirable properties for networks with nodes that share a finite resource. These include: (i) real-valuedness, (ii) non-locality and (iii) asymmetry. We show that they can be used to define a personalized measure of the importance of nodes in a network with a natural interpretation that leads to new methods to measure centrality. We show that the square of the leading eigenvector of an importance matrix defined using the GENs is strongly correlated with well-known measures such as PageRank, and define a personalized measure of centrality that is also well correlated with other existing measures. The utility of this measure of topological proximity is demonstrated by showing the asymmetries in both the dynamics of random walks and the mean infection time in epidemic spreading are better predicted by the topological definition of closeness provided by the GENs than they are by other measures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2054-5703			WOS:000443443000022	30224995	J	Buchholz, Patrick C.

The nodes represent individual sequences, and two nodes are connected by an edge if the global sequence identity of two sequences exceeds a threshold. The networks were characterized by their degree distribution (number of nodes with a given number of neighbors) and by their fractal network dimension. Although the five protein families differed in sequence length, fold, and domain arrangement, their network properties were similar. The fractal network dimension D-f was distance-dependent: a high dimension for single and double mutants (D-f = 4.0), which dropped to D-f = 0.7-1.0 at 90% sequence identity, and increased to D-f = 3.5-4.5 below 70% sequence identity. The distance dependency of the network dimension is consistent with evolutionary constraints for functional proteins. While random single and double mutations often result in a functional protein, the accumulation of more than ten mutations is dominated by epistasis. The networks of the five protein families were highly inhomogeneous with few highly connected communities ("hub sequences") and a large number of smaller and less connected communities. The degree distributions followed a power-law distribution with similar scaling exponents close to 1. Because the hub sequences have a large number of functional neighbors, they are expected to be robust toward possible deleterious effects of mutations. Because of their robustness, hub sequences have the potential of high innovability, with additional mutations readily inducing new functions. Therefore, they form hotspots of evolution and are promising candidates as starting points for directed evolution experiments in biotechnology.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000440415500055	30067815	J	Subelj, Lovro				Subelj, Lovro/V-9106-2018	Subelj, Lovro/0000-0002-4161-2260			Convex skeletons of complex networks								JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE				15	145					20180422	10.1098/rsif.2018.0422					AUG 2018	2018	A convex network can be defined as a network such that every connected induced subgraph includes all the shortest paths between its nodes. A fully convex network would therefore be a collection of cliques stitched together in a tree. In this paper, we study the largest high-convexity part of empirical networks obtained by removing the least number of edges, which we call a convex skeleton. A convex skeleton is a generalization of a network spanning tree in which each edge can be replaced by a clique of arbitrary size. We present different approaches for extracting convex skeletons and apply them to social collaboration and protein interactions networks, autonomous systems graphs and food webs. We show that the extracted convex skeletons retain the degree distribution, clustering, connectivity, distances, node position and also community structure, while making the shortest paths between the nodes largely unique. Moreover, in the Slovenian computer scientists co-authorship network, a convex skeleton retains the strongest ties between the authors, differently from a spanning tree or high-betweenness backbone and high-salience skeleton. A convex skeleton thus represents a simple definition of a network backbone with applications in coauthorship and other social collaboration networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1742-5689	1742-5662		WOS:000443333600025	30111666	J	Huang, Shouying; Jiang, Jifa								EPIDEMIC DYNAMICS ON COMPLEX NETWORKS WITH GENERAL INFECTION RATE AND IMMUNE STRATEGIES								DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS-SERIES B				23	6			2071	2090		10.3934/dcdsb.2018226					AUG 2018	2018	This paper mainly aims to study the influence of individuals' different heterogeneous contact patterns on the spread of the disease. For this purpose, an SIS epidemic model with a general form of heterogeneous infection rate is investigated on complex heterogeneous networks. A qualitative analysis of this model reveals that, depending on the epidemic threshold R-0, either the disease-free equilibrium or the endemic equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Interestingly, no matter what functional form the heterogeneous infection rate is, whether the disease will disappear or not is completely determined by the value of R-0, but the heterogeneous infection rate has close relation with the epidemic threshold R-0. Especially, the heterogeneous infection rate can directly affect the final number of infected nodes when the disease is endemic. The obtained results improve and generalize some known results. Finally, based on the heterogeneity of contact patterns, the effects of different immunization schemes are discussed and compared. Meanwhile, we explore the relation between the immunization rate and the recovery rate, which are the two important parameters that can be improved. To illustrate our theoretical results, the corresponding numerical simulations are also included.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1531-3492	1553-524X		WOS:000447276200002		J	Zhang, Rong; Ren, Zhao; Chen, Wei								SILGGM: An extensive R package for efficient statistical inference in large-scale gene networks								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				14	8					e1006369	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006369					AUG 2018	2018	Gene co-expression network analysis is extremely useful in interpreting a complex biological process. The recent droplet-based single-cell technology is able to generate much larger gene expression data routinely with thousands of samples and tens of thousands of genes. To analyze such a large-scale gene-gene network, remarkable progress has been made in rigorous statistical inference of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model (GGM). These approaches provide a formal confidence interval or a p-value rather than only a single point estimator for conditional dependence of a gene pair and are more desirable for identifying reliable gene networks. To promote their widespread use, we herein introduce an extensive and efficient R package named SILGGM (Statistical Inference of Large-scale Gaussian Graphical Model) that includes four main approaches in statistical inference of high-dimensional GGM. Unlike the existing tools, SILGGM provides statistically efficient inference on both individual gene pair and whole-scale gene pairs. It has a novel and consistent false discovery rate (FDR) procedure in all four methodologies. Based on the user-friendly design, it provides outputs compatible with multiple platforms for interactive network visualization. Furthermore, comparisons in simulation illustrate that SILGGM can accelerate the existing MATLAB implementation to several orders of magnitudes and further improve the speed of the already very efficient R package FastGGM. Testing results from the simulated data confirm the validity of all the approaches in SILGGM even in a very large-scale setting with the number of variables or genes to a ten thousand level. We have also applied our package to a novel single-cell RNA-seq data set with pan T cells. The results show that the approaches in SILGGM significantly outperform the conventional ones in a biological sense.

Accelerating GPU Betweenness Centrality								COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ACM				61	8			85	92							AUG 2018	2018	Graphs that model social networks, numerical simulations, and the structure of the Internet are enormous and cannot be manually inspected. A popular metric used to analyze these networks is Betweenness Centrality (BC), which has applications in community detection, power grid contingency analysis, and the study of the human brain. However, these analyses come with a high computational cost that prevents the examination of large graphs of interest.Recently, the use of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) has been promising for efficient processing of unstructured data sets. Prior GPU implementations of BC suffer from large local data structures and inefficient graph traversals that limit scalability and performance. Here we present a hybrid GPU implementation that provides good performance on graphs of arbitrary structure rather than just scale-free graphs as was done previously. Our methods achieve up to 13x speedup on high-diameter graphs and an average of 2.71x speedup overall compared to the best existing GPU algorithm. We also observe near linear speedup when running BC on 192 GPUs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-0782	1557-7317		WOS:000439630200022		J	Zhang, Yaming; Su, Yanyuan; Li Weigang; Liu, Haiou								Modeling rumor propagation and refutation with time effect in online social networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	8					1850068	10.1142/S0129183118500687					AUG 2018	2018	Rumor propagation and refutation form an important issue for spreading dynamics in online social networks (OSNs). In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage rumor propagation and refutation model with time effect for OSNs. The dynamical mechanism of rumor propagation and refutation with time effect is investigated deeply. Then a two-stage model and the corresponding mean-field equations in both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are obtained. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to characterize the dynamics of rumor propagation and refutation in both Watts-Strogatz network and Barabasi-Albert network. The results show that heterogeneous networks yield the most effective rumor and anti-rumor spreading. Besides, the sooner authority releases anti-rumor and the more attractive anti-rumor is, the less rumor influence is. What's more, these findings suggest that individuals' ability to control themselves and identify rumor accurately should be improved to reduce negative impact of rumor effectively. The results are helpful to understand better the mechanism of rumor propagation and refutation in OSNs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443597700006		J	Zhu, He; Ma, Jing								How the contact differences and individuals' similarity affect the rumor propagation process in complex heterogeneous networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	8					1850065	10.1142/S0129183118500651					AUG 2018	2018	In this paper, we investigate how the contact differences and individuals' similarity affect the rumor propagation process in complex heterogeneous networks. Unlike existing models that neglect the contact differences or assume the homogeneity of individuals' characteristics, the spreading rate in the proposed model is no longer deemed to be a constant, but it changes when the rumor spreads between different individuals. By means of the mean-field method, the spreading threshold and the final size of the rumor are explicitly derived. Two types of rumor control strategies are theoretically analyzed by comparing their effects on the spreading threshold. To verify the theoretical results, a series of numerical simulations are presented. The simulation results demonstrate that a lower contact rate impedes the diffusion process, and a higher degree of individuals' similarity promotes the flow of information among individuals. The two factors (i.e. high enough the contact rate and degree of individuals' similarity) are crucial to sustain the spreading process, and the absence of either of them would significantly increase the threshold. In addition, the results of the comparison of different control strategies suggest that controlling the spreading behavior of individuals with higher degrees can more effectively suppress the evolutionary process of the rumor.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443597700003		J	Takano, Chisa; Aida, Masaki								Revealing of the Underlying Mechanism of Different Node Centralities Based on Oscillation Dynamics on Networks								IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS				E101B	8			1820	1832		10.1587/transcom.2017EBP3370					AUG 2018	2018	In recent years, with the rapid development of the Internet and cloud computing, an enormous amount of information is exchanged on various social networking services. In order to handle and maintain such a mountain of information properly by limited resources in the network, it is very important to comprehend the dynamics for propagation of information or activity on the social network. One of many indices used by social network analysis which investigates the network structure is "node centrality". A common characteristic of conventional node centralities is that it depends on the topological structure of network and the value of node centrality does not change unless the topology changes. The network dynamics is generated by interaction between users whose strength is asymmetric in general. Network structure reflecting the asymmetric interaction between users is modeled by a directed graph, and it is described by an asymmetric matrix in matrix-based network model. In this paper, we showed an oscillation model for describing dynamics on networks generated from a certain kind of asymmetric interaction between nodes by using a symmetric matrix. Moreover, we propose a new extended index of well-known two node centralities based on the oscillation model. In addition, we show that the proposed index can describe various aspect of node centrality that considers not only the topological structure of the network, but also asymmetry of links, the distribution of source node of activity, and temporal evolution of activity propagation by properly assigning the weight of each link. The proposed model is regarded as the fundamental framework for different node centralities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0916-8516	1745-1345		WOS:000444151000009		J	Hartman, David; Hlinka, Jaroslav				Hartman, David/G-7107-2012; Hlinka, Jaroslav/E-1787-2013	Hartman, David/0000-0003-3566-8214; Hlinka, Jaroslav/0000-0003-1402-1470			Nonlinearity in stock networks								CHAOS				28	8					083127	10.1063/1.5023309					AUG 2018	2018	Stock networks, constructed from stock price time series, are a well-established tool for the characterization of complex behavior in stock markets. Following Mantegna's seminal paper, the linear Pearson's correlation coefficient between pairs of stocks has been the usual way to determine network edges. Recently, possible effects of nonlinearity on the graph-theoretical properties of such networks have been demonstrated when using nonlinear measures such as mutual information instead of linear correlation. In this paper, we quantitatively characterize the nonlinearity in stock time series and the effect it has on stock network properties. This is achieved by a systematic multi-step approach that allows us to quantify the nonlinearity of coupling; correct its effects wherever it is caused by simple univariate non-Gaussianity; potentially localize in space and time any remaining strong sources of this nonlinearity; and, finally, study the effect nonlinearity has on global network properties. By applying this multi-step approach to stocks included in three prominent indices (New York Stock Exchange 100, Financial Times Stock Exchange 100, and Standard & Poor 500), we establish that the apparent nonlinearity that has been observed is largely due to univariate non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, strong nonstationarity in a few specific stocks may play a role. In particular, the sharp decrease in some stocks during the global financial crisis of 2008 gives rise to apparent nonlinear dependencies among stocks.

A common way to model the relationship between different concepts is through complex networks. In such representations, networks' nodes store knowledge and edges represent their relationships. Several studies that considered this type of structure and knowledge acquisition dynamics employed one or more agents to discover node concepts by walking on the network. In this study, we investigate a different type of dynamics adopting a single node as the "network brain." Such a brain represents a range of real systems such as the information about the environment that is acquired by a person and is stored in the brain. To store the discovered information in a specific node, the agents walk on the network and return to the brain. We propose three different dynamics and test them on several network models and on a real system, which is formed by journal articles and their respective citations. The results revealed that, according to the adopted walking models, the efficiency of self-knowledge acquisition has only a weak dependency on topology and search strategy.

We consider this quantity averaged over all initial conditions for a searcher and multiple targets called the global MRST. We find that the growth of global MRST follows a recursive harmonic law with respect to that of stalking the individuals. In particular, when the diffusive laws of moving targets are identical, the global MRST shows a logarithmic increase with the number of moving targets. Moreover, utilizing the recursive harmonic law, we can accurately predict the expected successive time interval for capturing a new moving target. The recursive harmonic law unveils the underlying mechanism governing the search time when hunting for multiple moving targets on networks.

Mathematical models of these systems may involve hundreds of variables in thousands of individual cells resulting in an extremely high-dimensional description of the system. This often contrasts with the low-dimensional dynamics exhibited on the collective or macroscopic scale for these systems. We introduce a macroscopic reduction for networks of coupled oscillators motivated by an elegant structure we find in experimental measurements of circadian protein expression and several mathematical models for coupled biological oscillators. The observed structure in the collective amplitude of the oscillator population differs from the well-known Ott-Antonsen ansatz, but its emergence can be characterized through a simple argument depending only on general phase-locking behavior in coupled oscillator systems. We further demonstrate its emergence in networks of noisy heterogeneous oscillators with complex network connectivity. Applying this structure, we derive low-dimensional macroscopic models for oscillator population activity. This approach allows for the incorporation of cellular-level experimental data into the macroscopic model whose parameters and variables can then be directly associated with tissue- or organism-level properties, thereby elucidating the core properties driving the collective behavior of the system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2375-2548			WOS:000443498100001	30083596	J	Kundu, Srilena; Majhi, Soumen; Karmakar, Partha; Ghosh, Dibakar; Rakshit, Biswambhar				RAKSHIT, BISWAMBHAR/W-1530-2018	RAKSHIT, BISWAMBHAR/0000-0002-4289-5178			Augmentation of dynamical persistence in networks through asymmetric interaction								EPL				123	3					30001	10.1209/0295-5075/123/30001					AUG 2018	2018	There exists several natural instances in which systems may undergo through local degradation of its constituting elements. This may severely affect the overall dynamical activity in unexpected ways. So, it requires to overcome such situations while posing some appropriate mechanisms. In this work we investigate aging networks comprising different groups of dynamical units coupled locally, non-locally or globally. We provide a mechanism that deals with asymmetry in the interaction of active and inactive groups to enhance the dynamical robustness of such aging networks. Apart from numerical experiments, we provide analytical treatment to identify the critical phase transition. Mathematical results are found to perfectly match the outcomes obtained through numerical experiments. Moreover, we provide evidence of the enriched network survivability in more complex topologies considering small-world and scale-free networks. Our proposed method to enhance the dynamical robustness is thus independent of coupling topology and quite efficient in aging networks of coupled oscillators.

By means of the quasi-static approximation, we derive the condition for the epidemic threshold in a static multiplex network overlapped by the randomly connected subnetwork without clustering. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with continuous-time Gillespie algorithm-based simulations for 2-layer and 3-layer multiplex networks, revealing the advantage of our model in the prediction of epidemic spreading relative to the quenched mean-field (QMF) approach. Importantly, our study demonstrates that unlike the standard QMF approach, the pair QMF model can be used to assess the influence of the link overlap on the epidemic threshold, thereby carrying vital implications for future epidemiological research and policy development.

In order to realistically analyze the spreading mechanism and dynamical behavior of epidemic diseases, in this paper, a generalized disease transmission model of SIS type with age-dependent infection and birth and death on a heterogeneous network is discussed. The model allows the infection and recovery rates to vary and depend on the age of infection, the time since an individual becomes infected. We address uniform persistence and find that the model has the sharp threshold property, that is, for the basic reproduction number less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, while for the basic reproduction number is above one, a Lyapunov functional is used to show that the endemic equilibrium is globally stable. Finally, some numerical simulations are carried out to illustrate and complement the main results. The disease dynamics rely not only on the network structure, but also on an age-dependent factor (for some key functions concerned in the model).									2	0	0	0	0	2			0092-8240	1522-9602		WOS:000438293400003	29948881	J	Xu, Zengwang								The structure and dynamics of population migration among economic areas in the United States from 1990 to 2011								PAPERS IN REGIONAL SCIENCE				97	3			785	+		10.1111/pirs.12282					AUG 2018	2018	This study constructs the population migration networks among economic areas in the United States for every consecutive year from 1990 to 2011, and examines their structural properties and population migration dynamics. Various aspects of the structural properties of the networks are explored, including the connectivity, clustering, assortativity and centrality. It was found that these structural properties are mediated by migration dynamics and inter-area distance, and the patterns of varying structural properties across areas of different connectivity reveal the hub-and-spoke structure of the networks. It is evident that there exists tremendous complexity in migration connectivity and dynamics in the US internal migration system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1056-8190	1435-5957		WOS:000441754500015		J	Blaesius, Thomas; Friedrich, Tobias; Krohmer, Anton								Cliques in Hyperbolic Random Graphs								ALGORITHMICA				80	8			2324	2344		10.1007/s00453-017-0323-3					AUG 2018	2018	Most complex real world networks display scale-free features. This characteristic motivated the study of numerous random graph models with a power-law degree distribution. There is, however, no established and simple model which also has a high clustering of vertices as typically observed in real data. Hyperbolic random graphs bridge this gap. This natural model has recently been introduced by Krioukov et al. (in Phys Rev E 82(3):036106, 2010) and has shown theoretically and empirically to fulfill all typical properties of real world networks, including power-law degree distribution and high clustering. We study cliques in hyperbolic random graphs G and present new results on the expected number of k-cliques E[K-k] and the size of the largest clique omega(G). We observe that there is a phase transition at power-law exponent beta = 3. More precisely, for beta is an element of (2, 3) we prove E[K-k] = n(k(3-beta)/2)Theta(k)(-k) and omega(G) = Theta(n((3-beta)/2)), while for beta >= 3 we prove E[K-k] = n Theta (k)(-k) and omega(G) = Theta(log(n)/log log n). Furthermore, we show that for beta >= 3, cliques in hyperbolic random graphs can be computed in time O(n). If the underlying geometry is known, cliques can be found with worst-case runtime O(m . n(2.5)) for all values of beta.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0178-4617	1432-0541		WOS:000431857300005		J	Wu, Jiajing; Zhong, Jian; Chen, Zhenhao; Chen, Bokui								Optimal Coupling Patterns in Interconnected Communication Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				65	8			1109	1113		10.1109/TCSII.2018.2808297					AUG 2018	2018	Traffic dynamics on single or isolated complex networks has been extensively studied in the past decade. Recently, several coupled network models have been developed to describe the interactions between real-world networked systems. In interconnected communication networks, the coupling links refer to the physical links between networks and provide paths for traffic transmission. In this brief, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to find a near-optimal configuration of the coupling links, which effectively improves the overall traffic capacity compared with random, assortative, and disassortative couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration of coupling links given by the SA algorithm and develop a faster method to select the coupling links.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000440693200029		J	Clement, Julien; Puranam, Phanish								Searching for Structure: Formal Organization Design as a Guide to Network Evolution								MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				64	8			3879	3895		10.1287/mnsc.2017.2807					AUG 2018	2018	Is top-down organization design worth attempting at all, or should organizations simply let their members learn which patterns of interaction are valuable by themselves, through a bottom-up process? Our analysis of an agent-based computational model shows that weak enforcement of even a randomly selected formal structure in a top-down manner can usefully guide the bottom-up emergence of networks of intraorganizational interactions between agents. In the absence of formal structure, interactions are prone to decline within organizations, because maintaining interactions requires coordination but breaking them does not. Formal structure regenerates the network of interactions between agents, who can then learn which interactions to keep or discard. This "network regeneration effect" of formal structure offers a rationale for the importance of top-down organization design, even if the design is limited in accuracy and enforcement.									2	0	1	0	0	2			0025-1909	1526-5501		WOS:000440922200022		J	Biro, Csaba; Darji, Udayan B.

However, a fundamental difference between them can be observed: computer-based classification considers only physical features (e.g., similarity, distance, or distribution) of input data; by contrast, brain-based classification takes into account not only physical features, but also the organizational structure of data. In this paper, we figure out the data organizational structure for classification using complex networks constructed from training data. Specifically, an unlabeled instance is classified by the importance concept characterized by Google's PageRank measure of the underlying data networks. Before a test data instance is classified, a network is constructed from vector-based data set and the test instance is inserted into the network in a proper manner. To this end, we also propose a measure, called spatio-structural differential efficiency, to combine the physical and topological features of the input data. Such a method allows for the classification technique to capture a variety of data patterns using the unique importance measure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique has promising predictive performance on the detection of heart abnormalities.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2162-237X	2162-2388		WOS:000439627700005	28783640	J	Fiorini, L.; Aiello, M.; Poli, D.; Pelacchi, P.

Among several viable solutions, energy storage systems are the most promising to increase reliability and flexibility. This paper proposes a novel topological and probabilistic approach to find the optimal capacity and siting of energy storage devices, in order to increase the system reliability and the hosting capacity of renewables. Wind and solar productions, generators availability, and real-time demand are modeled with proper distribution functions, and the yearly expected energy not supplied is estimated using a sequential Monte Carlo technique. Four siting policies are applied and compared to place the optimal storage capacity on eight grids with different topological characteristics. Power flows are linearized and the optimization of resources is formulated as a linear programming problem. The results show that large-scale batteries operated by the Transmission System Operator can significantly improve system reliability and exploitation of RESs. The presence of energy-hubs and small-world properties strongly increase the transmission effectiveness of weakly-and well-meshed grids. A siting policy based on the Power Transfer Distribution Factors matrix of the grid turns out to be particularly successful.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2352-152X			WOS:000439496500032		J	Choi, Daejin; Han, Jinyoung; Chun, Selin; Rappos, Efstratios; Robert, Stephan; Kwon, Ted Taekyoung								Bit.ly/practice: Uncovering content publishing and sharing through URL shortening services								TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS				35	5			1310	1323		10.1016/j.tele.2018.03.003					AUG 2018	2018	becomes the norm for people to share online content such as images, videos, and news over various channels including online social networks, news media, or online communities.

In many situations, to recover the missing data or predict the network evolution, we need to predict link weights in a network. In this paper, we first proposed a series of new centrality indices for links in line graph. Then, utilizing these line graph indices, as well as a number of original graph indices, we designed three supervised learning methods to realize link weight prediction both in the networks of single layer and multiple layers, which perform much better than several recently proposed baseline methods. We found that the resource allocation index (RA) plays a more important role in the weight prediction than other topological properties, and the line graph indices are at least as important as the original graph indices in link weight prediction. In particular, the success application of our methods on Yelp layered network suggests that we can indeed predict the offline co-foraging behaviors of users just based on their online social interactions, which may open a new direction for link weight prediction algorithms, and meanwhile provide insights to design better restaurant recommendation systems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1041-4347	1558-2191		WOS:000438067400008		J	Jones, Michael N.; Gruenenfelder, Thomas M.; Recchia, Gabriel								In defense of spatial models of semantic representation								NEW IDEAS IN PSYCHOLOGY				50				54	60		10.1016/j.newideapsych.2017.08.001					AUG 2018	2018	Recent semantic space models learn vector representations for word meanings by observing statistical redundancies across a text corpus. A word's meaning is represented as a point in a high-dimensional semantic space, and semantic similarity between words is quantified by a function of their spatial proximity (typically the cosine of the angle between their corresponding vector representations). Recently, Griffiths, Steyvers, and Tenenbaum (2007) demonstrated that spatial models are unable to simulate human free association data due to the constraints placed upon them by metric axioms which appear to be violated in association norms. However, it is important to note that free association data is the product of a retrieval process operating on a semantic representation, and the failures of spatial models are likely be due to mistaking the similarity metric (cosine) for an appropriate process model of the association task cosine is not what people do with a memory representation. Here, we test the ability of spatial semantic models to simulate association data when they are fused with a simple Luce choice rule to simulate the process of selecting a response in free association. The results provide an existence proof that spatial models can produce the patterns of data in free association previously thought to be problematic for this class of models. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Anti-epileptic therapies have been developed largely based on the dogma that the altered brain rhythms result from an overabundance of glutamatergic activity or insufficient GABAergic inhibition. The most effective drugs in use today act to globally decrease excitation, increase inhibition, or decrease all activity. Unfortunately, such broad alterations to brain activity often lead to impactful side effects such as drowsiness, cognitive impairment, and sleep disruption. Recent advances in optical imaging, optogenetics, and chemogenetics have made it feasible to record and alter neuronal activity with single neuron resolution and genetically directed targeting. The goal of this review it to summarize the usage of these research tools in the study of ictogenesis (seizure generation) and propose a translational pathway by which these studies could result in novel clinical therapies. This manuscript is not intended to serve as an exhaustive list of optogenetic tools nor as a summary of all optogenetic manipulations in epilepsy research. Rather, we will focus on the tools and research aimed at dissecting the basic neuron-level interactions underlying ictogenesis.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1741-2560	1741-2552		WOS:000431490200001	29536948	J	Xu, Hedong; Tian, Cunzhi; Xiao, Xinrong; Fan, Suohai								Evolutionary investors' power-based game on networks								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				330				125	133		10.1016/j.amc.018.02.041					AUG 1 2018	2018	The classical prisoner dilemma game on networks ignores the heterogeneity of players that may lead to the remarkable differences of their payoffs in reality. With the consideration of the heterogeneity, we propose an investors' power-based game, where the payoffs of defectors depend on the efficiency of market and the related-power against cooperators. Economically, the efficiency of the market of investment is introduced in the game through a parameter alpha that becomes a key factor in the evolutionary process. Our simulation results show that, an improvement of efficiency benefits for the cooperation fundamentally. Furthermore, comparing with the result on BA scale-free networks, the evolution of cooperation performs great stability on WS small-world networks against the change of market efficiency. As the network of investment in real world may possess both of the properties of WS small-world networks and BA scale-free networks, the findings may be helpful in understanding and controlling the behaviors on the network of investment.

A simple and efficient way to quantify network differences remains unexplored. Although the methods for network comparison based on the probability distribution of a network descriptor have been shown to be effective for specific purposes, the information they provide is often limited or incomplete. In order to overcome the defect of the methods, here we use the communicability between two nodes to define the communicability sequence entropy of networks, and on the basis of this entropy measure, we propose a Jensen-Shannon divergence of two networks which can be used as natural distance measure between complex networks. By the extensive experiments, we find that the measure can accurately quantify the structural dissimilarities between synthetic networks. Most importantly, the measure can be able to identify the critical percolation probability of the random network in the evolution process, and it can also effectively guide us to choose a more suitable model to simulate real systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000440385600006	30110844	J	Limdi, Anurag; Perez-Escudero, Alfonso; Li, Aming; Gore, Jeff					Li, Aming/0000-0003-4045-8721			Asymmetric migration decreases stability but increases resilience in a heterogeneous metapopulation								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				9						2969	10.1038/s41467-018-05424-w					JUL 30 2018	2018	Many natural populations are spatially distributed, forming a network of subpopulations linked by migration. Migration patterns are often asymmetric and heterogeneous, with important consequences on the ecology and evolution of the species. Here we investigate experimentally how asymmetric migration and heterogeneous structure affect a simple metapopulation of budding yeast, formed by one strain that produces a public good and a non- producer strain that benefits from it. We study metapopulations with star topology and asymmetric migration, finding that all their subpopulations have a higher fraction of producers than isolated populations. Furthermore, the metapopulations have lower tolerance to challenging environments but higher resilience to transient perturbations. This apparent paradox occurs because tolerance to a constant challenge depends on the weakest subpopulations of the network, while resilience to a transient perturbation depends on the strongest ones.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2041-1723			WOS:000440149300002	30061665	J	Miranda, Pedro Jeferson; Baptista, Murilo Silva; de Souza Pinto, Sandro Ely				baptista, murilo/B-7277-2008	Pinto, Sandro/0000-0002-3534-3893			The Odyssey's mythological network								PLOS ONE				13	7					e0200703	10.1371/journal.pone.0200703					JUL 30 2018	2018	In this work, we study the mythological network of Odyssey of Homer.

We found that Odyssey can be classified both as real and fictional network. This statement is supported as far as mythological characters are removed, which results in a network with real properties. The community analysis indicated to us that there is a power-law relationship based on the max degree of each community.

Such 'small-world properties' are often guided by a scale-free power-law distribution of the node degrees, and self-organization inside the network has been identified as a reason driving the emergence of this structure. Small-world networks have recently raised lots of interest, because they capture the global topology of the World-Wide Web, metabolic, and social networks. While small-world networks reflect global structures, little attention is paid to the local structure of complex networks. In this article neighbourhoods are demonstrated to share a common local structure in many real complex networks, manifested by a polynomial volume law. This law can, in case of networks that are embedded in space, be explained in terms of the embedding and the properties of Euclidean space. A model of hierarchical spatial networks is introduced to examine the effect of global structures, in particular of hierarchies, on the polynomial volume law. It turns out that the law is robust against the coexistence of such global structures. The local structure of space and global optimization can both be found in transport, brain, and communication networks, which suggests the polynomial volume law, often in combination with hierarchies or other global optimization principles, to be a generic property inherent to many networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000439964500001	30054491	J	Defoort, Jonas; Van de Peer, Yves; Vermeirssen, Vanessa					Defoort, Jonas/0000-0003-2393-6592; Vermeirssen, Vanessa/0000-0002-1975-0712			Function, dynamics and evolution of network motif modules in integrated gene regulatory networks of worm and plant								NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH				46	13			6480	6503		10.1093/nar/gky468					JUL 27 2018	2018	Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consist of different molecular interactions that closely work together to establish proper gene expression in time and space. Especially in higher eukaryotes, many questions remain on how these interactions collectively coordinate gene regulation. We study high quality GRNs consisting of undirected protein-protein, genetic and homologous interactions, and directed protein-DNA, regulatory and miRNA-mRNA interactions in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the plant Ara-bidopsis thaliana. Our data-integration framework integrates interactions in composite network motifs, clusters these in biologically relevant, higher-order topological network motif modules, overlays these with gene expression profiles and discovers novel connections between modules and regulators. Similar modules exist in the integrated GRNs of worm and plant. We show how experimental or computational methodologies underlying a certain data type impact network topology. Through phylogenetic decomposition, we found that proteins of worm and plant tend to functionally interact with proteins of a similar age, while at the regulatory level TFs favor same age, but also older target genes. Despite some influence of the duplication mode difference, we also observe at the motif and module level for both species a preference for age homogeneity for undirected and age heterogeneity for directed interactions. This leads to a model where novel genes are added together to the GRNs in a specific biological functional context, regulated by one or more TFs that also target older genes in the GRNs. Overall, we detected topological, functional and evolutionary properties of GRNs that are potentially universal in all species.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0305-1048	1362-4962		WOS:000444130700012	29873777	J	Liu, Yang; Wang, Xi; Kurths, Juergen								Optimization of targeted node set in complex networks under percolation and selection								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	1					012313	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.012313					JUL 23 2018	2018	Most of the existing methods for the robustness and targeted immunization problems can be viewed as greedy strategies, which are quite efficient but readily induce a local optimization. In this paper, starting from a percolation perspective, we develop two strategies, the relationship-related (RR) strategy and the prediction relationship (PR) strategy, to avoid a local optimum only through the investigation of interrelationships among nodes. Meanwhile, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation, and PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this manner our methods have a better capability to collapse or protect a network. The simulations performed on a number of networks also demonstrate their effectiveness, especially on large real-world networks where RR fragments each of them into the same size of the giant component; however, RR needs only less than 90% of the number of nodes which are necessary for the most excellent existing methods.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000439414800006	30110741	J	Karimi, Fariba; Genois, Mathieu; Wagner, Claudia; Singer, Philipp; Strohmaier, Markus					Genois, Mathieu/0000-0001-5492-8750			Homophily influences ranking of minorities in social networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						11077	10.1038/s41598-018-29405-7					JUL 23 2018	2018	Homophily can put minority groups at a disadvantage by restricting their ability to establish links with a majority group or to access novel information. Here, we show how this phenomenon can influence the ranking of minorities in examples of real-world networks with various levels of heterophily and homophily ranging from sexual contacts, dating contacts, scientific collaborations, and scientific citations. We devise a social network model with tunable homophily and group sizes, and demonstrate how the degree ranking of nodes from the minority group in a network is a function of (i) relative group sizes and (ii) the presence or absence of homophilic behaviour. We provide analytical insights on how the ranking of the minority can be improved to ensure the representativeness of the group and correct for potential biases. Our work presents a foundation for assessing the impact of homophilic and heterophilic behaviour on minorities in social networks.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000439421600045	30038426	J	Banerjee, Bitan; Kulkarni, Adita; Seetharam, Anand					Seetharam, Anand/0000-0003-4559-7886			Greedy Caching: An optimized content placement strategy for information-centric networks								COMPUTER NETWORKS				140				78	91		10.1016/j.comnet.2018.05.001					JUL 20 2018	2018	Most content placement strategies in information-centric networks (ICN) primarily focus on pushing popular content to the network edge, fail to effectively utilize the caches in the network core and provide limited performance improvement. In this paper, we propose Greedy Caching, a content placement strategy that determines the set of content to be cached at each network node so as to maximize the network hit rate. Greedy Caching caches the most popular content at the network edge, recalculates the relative popularity of each piece of content based on the request miss stream from downstream caches and then determines the content to be cached in the network core. We perform exhaustive simulation in the Icarus simulator [1] using realistic Internet topologies (e.g., GARR, GEANT, WIDE, scale-free networks) as well as real-world request stream traces, and demonstrate that Greedy Caching provides significant improvement in content download delay (referred to as latency) over state-of-the-art dynamic caching and routing strategies for ICN for a wide range of simulation parameters. Our simulation results suggest an improvement of 5-28% in latency and 15-50% improvement in hit rate over state-of-the-art policies for synthetic traces. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

What causes inequality to emerge and persist? In this study, we investigate how the structure and rules of our interactions can increase inequality in social groups. Specifically, we look into the effects of four structural conditions-network structure, network fluidity, reputation tracking, and punishment institutions-on the distribution of earnings in network cooperation games. We analyze 33 experiments comprising 96 experimental conditions altogether. We find that there is more inequality in clustered networks compared to random networks, in fixed networks compared to randomly rewired and strategically updated networks, and in groups with punishment institutions compared to groups without. Secondary analyses suggest that the reasons inequality emerges under these conditions may have to do with the fact that fixed networks allow exploitation of the poor by the wealthy and clustered networks foster segregation between the poor and the wealthy, while the burden of costly punishment falls onto the poor, leaving them poorer. Surprisingly, we do not find evidence that inequality is affected by reputation in a systematic way but this could be because reputation needs to play out in a particular network environment in order to have an effect. Overall, our findings suggest possible strategies and interventions to decrease inequality and mitigate its negative impact, particularly in the context of mid- and large-sized organizations and online communities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000439396900028	30028884	J	Fan, Huawei; Lai, Ying-Cheng; Wang, Xingang				Wang, Xingang/G-1746-2014	Wang, Xingang/0000-0002-6851-0109			Enhancing network synchronization by phase modulation								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				98	1					012212	10.1103/PhysRevE.98.012212					JUL 20 2018	2018	Due to time delays in signal transmission and processing, phase lags are inevitable in realistic complex oscillator networks. Conventional wisdom is that phase lags are detrimental to network synchronization. Here we show that judiciously chosen phase lag modulations can result in significantly enhanced network synchronization. We justify our strategy of phase modulation, demonstrate its power in facilitating and enhancing network synchronization with synthetic and empirical network models, and provide an analytic understanding of the underlying mechanism. Our work provides an alternative approach to synchronization optimization in complex networks, with insights into control of complex nonlinear networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000439306300003	30110721	J	Margiotta, Riccardo Giuseppe; Kuhn, Reimer; Sollich, Peter				Sollich, Peter/H-2174-2011	Sollich, Peter/0000-0003-0169-7893; Margiotta, Riccardo Giuseppe/0000-0001-8726-8429; Kuehn, Reimer/0000-0001-8030-1951			Spectral properties of the trap model on sparse networks								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL				51	29					294001	10.1088/1751-8121/aac67a					JUL 20 2018	2018	One of the simplest models for the slow relaxation and aging of glasses is the trap model by Bouchaud and others, which represents a system as a point in configuration-space hopping between local energy minima. The time evolution depends on the transition rates and the network of allowed jumps between the minima. We consider the case of sparse configuration-space connectivity given by a random graph, and study the spectral properties of the resulting master operator. We develop a general approach using the cavity method that gives access to the density of states in large systems, as well as localisation properties of the eigenvectors, which are important for the dynamics. We illustrate how, for a system with sparse connectivity and finite temperature, the density of states and the average inverse participation ratio have attributes that arise from a non-trivial combination of the corresponding mean field (fully connected) and random walk (infinite temperature) limits. In particular, we find a range of eigenvalues for which the density of states is of mean-field form but localisation properties are not, and speculate that the corresponding eigenvectors may be concentrated on extensively many clusters of network sites.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8113	1751-8121		WOS:000435213200001		J	Liu, Lu; Wang, Yang; Sinatra, Roberta; Giles, C.

Although hot streaks have been widely debated in sports(1,2), gambline(3-5) and financial markets(6,7)over the past several decades, little is known about whether they apply to individual careers. Here, building on rich literature on the lifecycle of creativity(8-22), we collected large-scale career histories of individual artists, film directors and scientists, tracing the artworks, films and scientific publications they produced. We find that, across all three domains, hit works within a career show a high degree of temporal regularity, with each career being characterized by bursts of high-impact works occurring in sequence. We demonstrate that these observations can be explained by a simple hot-streak model, allowing us to probe quantitatively the hot streak phenomenon governing individual careers. We find this phenomemon to be remarkably universal across diverse domains: hot streaks are ubiquitous yet usually unique across different careers. The hot streak emerges randomly within an individual's sequence of works, is temporally localized, and is not associated with any detectable change in productivity. We show that, because works produced during hot streaks garner substantially more impact, the uncovered hot streaks fundamentally drive the collective impact of an individual, and ignoring this leads us to systematically overestimate or underestimate the future impact of a career. These results not only deepen our quantitative understanding of patterns that govern individual ingenuity and success, but also may have implications for identifying and nurturing individuals whose work will have lasting impact.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000439059800055	29995850	J	Topirceanu, Alexandru; Udrescu, Mihai; Marculescu, Radu								Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment: A New Mechanism Explaining Social Network Formation and Evolution								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						10871	10.1038/s41598-018-29224-w					JUL 18 2018	2018	The dynamics of social networks is a complex process, as there are many factors which contribute to the formation and evolution of social links. While certain real-world properties are captured by the degree-driven preferential attachment model, it still cannot fully explain social network dynamics. Indeed, important properties such as dynamic community formation, link weight evolution, or degree saturation cannot be completely and simultaneously described by state of the art models. In this paper, we explore the distribution of social network parameters and centralities and argue that node degree is not the main attractor of new social links. Consequently, as node betweenness proves to be paramount to attracting new links - as well as strengthening existing links -, we propose the new Weighted Betweenness Preferential Attachment (WBPA) model, which renders quantitatively robust results on realistic network metrics. Moreover, we support our WBPA model with a socio-psychological interpretation, that offers a deeper understanding of the mechanics behind social network dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000439026000032	30022079	J	Corominas-Murtra, Bernat; Hanel, Rudolf; Zavojanni, Leonardo; Thurner, Stefan								How driving rates determine the statistics of driven non-equilibrium systems with stationary distributions								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						10837	10.1038/s41598-018-28962-1					JUL 18 2018	2018	Sample space reducing (SSR) processes offer a simple analytical way to understand the origin and ubiquity of power-laws in many path-dependent complex systems. SRR processes show a wide range of applications that range from fragmentation processes, language formation to search and cascading processes. Here we argue that they also offer a natural framework to understand stationary distributions of generic driven non-equilibrium systems that are composed of a driving and a relaxing process. We show that the statistics of driven non-equilibrium systems can be derived from the understanding of the nature of the underlying driving process. For constant driving rates exact power-laws emerge with exponents that are related to the driving rate. If driving rates become state-dependent, or if they vary across the life-span of the process, the functional form of the state-dependence determines the statistics. Constant driving rates lead to exact power-laws, a linear state-dependence function yields exponential or Gamma distributions, a quadratic function produces the normal distribution. Logarithmic and power-law state dependence leads to log-normal and stretched exponential distribution functions, respectively. Also Weibull, Gompertz and Tsallis-Pareto distributions arise naturally from simple state-dependent driving rates. We discuss a simple physical example of consecutive elastic collisions that exactly represents a SSR process.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000439024800002	30022170	J	Seal, Abhik; Wild, David J.

The package provides utilities to compute missing links in a bipartite and well as unipartite networks using Random Walk with Restart and Network inference algorithm and a combination of both. The package also allows computation of Bipartite network properties, visualization of communities for two different sets of nodes, and calculation of significant interactions between two sets of nodes using permutation based testing. The application can also be used to search for top-K shortest paths between interactome and use enrichment analysis for disease, pathway and ontology. The R standalone package (including detailed introductory vignettes) and associated R Shiny web application is available under the GPL-2 Open Source license and is freely available to download.Results: We compared different algorithms performance in different small datasets and found random walk supersedes rest of the algorithms. The package is developed to perform network based prediction of unipartite and bipartite networks and use the results to understand the functionality of proteins in an interactome using enrichment analysis.Conclusion: The rapid application development envrionment like shiny, helps non programmers to develop fast rich visualization apps and we beleieve it would continue to grow in future with further enhancements. We plan to update our algorithms in the package in near future and help scientist to analyse data in a much streamlined fashion.									2	0	0	1	0	2			1471-2105			WOS:000438972700001	30012095	J	Tanase, Radu; Tessone, Claudio J.; Algesheimer, Rene A.								Identification of influencers through the wisdom of crowds								PLOS ONE				13	7					e0200109	10.1371/journal.pone.0200109					JUL 16 2018	2018	Identifying individuals who are influential in diffusing information, ideas or products in a population remains a challenging problem. Most extant work can be abstracted by a process in which researchers first decide which features describe an influencer and then identify them as the individuals with the highest values of these features. This makes the identification dependent on the relevance of the selected features and it still remains uncertain if triggering the identified influencers leads to a behavioral change in others. Furthermore, most work was developed for cross-sectional or time-aggregated datasets, where the time-evolution of influence processes cannot be observed. We show that mapping the influencer identification to a wisdom of crowds problem overcomes these limitations. We present a framework in which the individuals in a social group repeatedly evaluate the contribution of other members according to what they perceive as valuable and not according to predefined features. We propose a method to aggregate the behavioral reactions of the members of the social group into a collective judgment that considers the temporal variation of influence processes. Using data from three large news providers, we show that the members of the group surprisingly agree on who are the influential individuals. The aggregation method addresses different sources of heterogeneity encountered in social systems and leads to results that are easily interpretable and comparable within and across systems. The approach we propose is computationally scalable and can be applied to any social systems where behavioral reactions are observable.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000438829800011	30011290	J	Gan, Yanxiong; Zheng, Shichao; Zhao, Jiaqi; Zhang, Chen; Gao, Tianhui; Liao, Wan; Fu, Qiang; Fu, Chaomei								Protein network module-based identification of key pharmacological pathways of Curcuma phaeocaulis Val. acting on hepatitis								JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY				221				10	19		10.1016/j.jep.2018.03.004					JUL 15 2018	2018	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Curcuma phaeocaulis Val. (CP), as the vital medicines for blood-breaking and disorder-eliminating, has been widely used for hepatitis with good curative effects. Owing to the complexity of traditional Chinese medicine, the pharmacological mechanism of CP remains unclear. To solve this problem, a protein network module-based approach was proposed in this study.Materials and methods: Firstly, the content of active components of CP was detected based on HPLC-DAD. Then the liver protection of CP on Con A-induced hepatitis was validated via the analysis of serum levels of ALT, AST and LDH and histological findings. Next, the targets of CP components obtained from TCMD database were predicted by STITCH and ChEMBL retrieval. In addition, the protein interaction network (PIN) of CP was constructed by Cytoscape based on protein-protein interaction of targets obtained from STRING database. Following the topological analysis of CP PIN, it showed to exhibit the properties of scale-free, small world, and modularity matched with the property of complex biological networks. Finally, the functional modules were identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis based on Molecular Complex Detection algorithm.Results: The functional modules indicated that the mechanism of CP acting on the hepatitis is significantly associated with NF-kappa B and TGF-beta signaling pathway. More interestingly, curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin were the main active components of CP acting on the hepatitis, which were demonstrated to be associated with the inflammatory process that occurs during the progression of hepatitis.Conclusion: The protein network module-based approach is an efficient way to investigate the pharmacological mechanisms of CP.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0378-8741			WOS:000435060000002	29526702	J	Guan, Jianfeng; Wei, Zhijun; You, Ilsun								GRBC-based Network Security Functions placement scheme in SDS for 5G security								JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS				114				48	56		10.1016/j.jnca.2018.03.013					JUL 15 2018	2018	With the paradigm shift of 5G in terms of computing and infrastructure, 5G security is confronted with new challenges due to the promising introduction of Software Defined Networks (SDN), Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Cloud Computing. While most of current works on 5G security are focused on high-level analysis of challenges and threats to satisfy the emerging use cases. Software Defined Security (SDS), as a new security paradigm which provides flexible and centralized security protection for varieties of networks especially for SDN and Cloud environment, can be a potential security solution in 5G. Lots of work have focused on the implementations and details of SDS, and most researchers, however, are focusing on the controller design and security policy design. There are few work on the placement strategy of Network Security Functions (NSFs) and devices, which plays a significant role in SDS to improve the optimize defence effects. Most of existing placement schemes are modelled as Integer Linear Programming (ILP) by considering the constrains in terms of resource, time, security and so on, and introduce various heuristic algorithm to reduce its computing complexity. While in this paper, we propose a placement scheme of NSFs and devices in SDS based on underlying routing characteristic and evaluate its performance defending virus attack. The proposed scheme adopts Group Routing Betweenenss Centrality (GRBC) as a metric and introduces a successive algorithm to compute the GRBC. Different to traditional Routing Betweenness Centrality which only considers the importance of single node, the proposed scheme can find the key group of nodes in a SDS underlying network, where the NSFs and security devices should be deployed. In the performance evaluation, we apply our scheme to the scenario of computer virus and worms control in SDS, and the results show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of security functions in SDS system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1084-8045			WOS:000435056600004		J	Xie, Pinchen; Yang, Bingjia; Zhang, Zhongzhi; Andrade, Roberto F.

It amounts to successively increasing number of contributions at any finite step of construction of the tree, resulting in a causal chain. The resulting eigenvalues can be related the full energy spectrum of a nearest-neighbor tight-binding model defined on this structure. Given this association, it turns out that further properties of the eigenvectors can be evaluated, like the degree of quantum localization of the tight-binding eigenstates, expressed by the inverse participation ratio (IPR). It happens that, for the current model, the IPR's are also suitable to be analytically expressed in terms in corresponding eigenvalue chain. The resulting IPR scaling behavior is expressed by the tails of eigenvalue chains as well. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

To reduce some of the market inefficiencies, more and more firms collaborate with innovation intermediaries. In light of the increasing importance of intermediary in the context of open innovation, we in this paper systematically investigate the effect of innovation intermediary on knowledge transfer and innovation process in networked systems. We find that the existence of innovation intermediary is conducive to the knowledge diffusion and facilitate the knowledge growth at system level. Interestingly, the scale of the innovation intermediary has little effect on the growth of knowledge. We further investigate the selection of intermediary members by comparing four selection strategies: random selection, initial knowledge level based selection, absorptive capability based selection, and innovative ability based selection. It is found that the selection strategy based on innovative ability outperforms all the other strategies in promoting the system knowledge growth. Our study provides a theoretical understanding of the impact of innovation intermediary on knowledge transfer and sheds light on the design and selection of innovation intermediary in open innovation.

Take physical significance of spatial diffusion into account, a diffusion threshold is set under which the rumor is not a trend topic and only spreads along determined physical connections. Heterogeneity of degree distribution and distance distribution has also been considered in theoretical model at the same time. The global existence and uniqueness of classical solution are proved with a Lyapunov function and an approximate classical solution in form of infinite series is constructed with a system of eigenfunction. Simulations and numerical solutions both on Watts-Strogatz (WS) network and Barabasi-Albert (BA) network display the variation of density of infected connections from spatial and temporal dimensions. Relevant results show that the density of infected connections is dominated by network topology and uncertainty of human behavior at threshold time. With increase of social capability, rumor diffuses to the steady state in a higher speed. And the variation trends of diffusion size with uncertainty are diverse on different artificial networks.

Criticality has been argued to provide biological systems with an optimal balance between robustness against perturbations and flexibility to adapt to changing conditions as well as to confer on them optimal computational capabilities, large dynamical repertoires, unparalleled sensitivity to stimuli, etc. Criticality, with its concomitant scale invariance, can be conjectured to emerge in living systems as the result of adaptive and evolutionary processes that, for reasons to be fully elucidated, select for it as a template upon which further layers of complexity can rest. This hypothesis is suggestive as it proposes that criticality could constitute a general and common organizing strategy in biology stemming from the physics of phase transitions. However, despite its implications, this is still in its infancy state as a well-founded theory and, as such, it has elicited some skepticism. From the experimental side, the advent of high-throughput technologies has created new prospects in the exploration of biological systems, and empirical evidence in favor of criticality has proliferated, with examples ranging from endogenous brain activity and gene-expression patterns to flocks of birds and insect-colony foraging, to name but a few. Some pieces of evidence are quite remarkable, while in some other cases empirical data are limited, incomplete, or not fully convincing. More stringent experimental setups and theoretical analyses are certainly needed to fully clarify the picture. In any case, the time seems ripe for bridging the gap between this theoretical conjecture and its empirical validation. Given the profound implications of shedding light on this issue, it is both pertinent and timely to review the state of the art and to discuss future strategies and perspectives.									14	0	0	3	0	14			0034-6861	1539-0756		WOS:000438044200001		J	Sato, Shumpei; Horikawa, Makoto; Kondo, Takeshi; Sato, Tomohito; Setou, Mitsutoshi					Horikawa, Makoto/0000-0002-5094-7070			A power law distribution of metabolite abundance levels in mice regardless of the time and spatial scale of analysis								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						10315	10.1038/s41598-018-28667-5					JUL 9 2018	2018	Biomolecule abundance levels change with the environment and enable a living system to adapt to the new conditions. Although, the living system maintains at least some characteristics, e.g. homeostasis. One of the characteristics maintained by a living system is a power law distribution of biomolecule abundance levels. Previous studies have pointed to a universal characteristic of biochemical reaction networks, with data obtained from lysates of multiple cells. As a result, the spatial scale of the data related to the power law distribution of biomolecule abundance levels is not clear. In this study, we researched the scaling law of metabolites in mouse tissue with a spatial scale of quantification that was changed stepwise between a whole-tissue section and a single-point analysis (25 mu m). As a result, metabolites in mouse tissues were found to follow the power law distribution independently of the spatial scale of analysis. Additionally, we tested the temporal changes by comparing data from younger and older mice. Both followed similar power law distributions, indicating that metabolite composition is not diversified by aging to disrupt the power law distribution. The power law distribution of metabolite abundance is thus a robust characteristic of a living system regardless of time and space.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000437830200011	29985415	J	Teixeira, Andreia Sofia; Monteiro, Pedro T.; Carrico, Joao A.; Santos, Francisco C.; Francisco, Alexandre P.

However, all epidemiological studies are limited to their sampling capacities which, by being usually biased or limited due to economic constraints, can hamper the real knowledge of the bacterial population structure of a given species. To this end, mathematical models and large-scale simulations can provide a quantitative analytical framework that can be used to assess how or if limited sampling can infer the true population structure. In this article, we address the large-scale simulation of genetic evolution of bacterial populations, using Wright-Fisher model, in the presence of complex host contact networks. We present an efficient approach for large-scale simulations over complex host contact networks, using MapReduce on top of Apache Spark and GraphX API. We evaluate the relation between cluster computing power and simulations speedup and include insights on how bacterial population diversity can be affected by mutation and recombination rates, and network topology.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1066-5277	1557-8666		WOS:000438169800001	29985650	J	Estrada-Pena, Agustin; Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro; Pollet, Thomas; Vayssier-Taussat, Muriel; Cosson, Jean-Francois				Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/P-2755-2017	Cabezas-Cruz, Alejandro/0000-0002-8660-730X; Estrada Pena, Agustin/0000-0001-7483-046X			High Throughput Sequencing and Network Analysis Disentangle the Microbial Communities of Ticks and Hosts Within and Between Ecosystems								FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY				8						236	10.3389/fcimb.2018.00236					JUL 9 2018	2018	We aimed to develop a framework, based on graph theory, to capture the ecological meaning behind pure pair comparisons of microbiome-derived data. As a proof of concept, we applied the framework to analyze the co-occurrence of bacteria in either Ixodes ricinus ticks or the spleen of one of their main hosts, the vole Myodes glareolus. As a secondary lymphoid organ, the spleen acts as a filter of blood and represents well the exposure to microorganisms circulating in the blood; including those acquired and transmitted by ticks during feeding. The microbiome of 301 and 269 individual tick and vole samples, respectively, were analyzed using next generation sequencing (NGS) of 16S rRNA. To assess the effect of habitat on ecological communities of bacteria associated to ticks and voles, two different biotopes were included in the study, forest, and ecotone. An innovative approach of NGS data analysis combining network analysis and phylogenies of co-occuring of bacteria was used to study associations between bacteria in individual samples. Of the 126 bacterial genera found in ticks and voles, 62% were shared by both species. Communities of co-occurring bacteria were always more phylogenetically diverse in ticks than in voles. Interestingly, similar to 80% of bacterial phylogenetic diversity was found in similar to 20% of ticks. This pattern was not observed in vole-associated bacteria. Results revealed that the microbiome of I. ricinus is only slightly related to that of M. glareolus and that the biotope plays the most important role in shaping the bacterial communities of either ticks or voles. The analysis of the phylogenetic signal of the network indexes across the 16S rRNA-derived tree of bacteria suggests that the microbiome of both ticks and voles has high phylogenetic diversity and that closest bacterial genera do not co-occur. This study shows that network analysis is a promising tool to unravel complex microbial communities associated to arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2235-2988			WOS:000438102900002	30038903	J	Jentsch, Peter C.; Anand, Madhur; Bauch, Chris T.

However, this effect has been little studied in the context of the complex interactions between disease dynamics and vaccinating behaviour. Our objective was to determine whether critical slowing down (CSD) occurs in a multiplex network that captures opinion propagation on one network layer and disease spread on a second network layer. We parameterized a network simulation model to represent a hypothetical self-limiting, acute, vaccine-preventable infection with short-lived natural immunity. We tested five different network types: random, lattice, small-world, scale-free, and an empirically derived network. For the first four network types, the model exhibits a regime shift as perceived vaccine risk moves beyond a tipping point from full vaccine acceptance and disease elimination to full vaccine refusal and disease endemicity. This regime shift is preceded by an increase in the spatial correlation in non-vaccinator opinions beginning well before the bifurcation point, indicating CSD. The early warning signals occur across a wide range of parameter values. However, the more gradual transition exhibited in the empirically-derived network underscores the need for further research before it can be determined whether trends in spatial correlation in real-world social networks represent critical slowing down. The potential upside of having this monitoring ability suggests that this is a worthwhile area for further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

A spectral clustering approach to network-aware virtual request partitioning								COMPUTER NETWORKS				139				70	80		10.1016/j.comnet.2018.04.005					JUL 5 2018	2018	Virtual request partitioning is an essential subproblem of two common problems in virtual networks, namely, virtual network embedding (VNE) and virtual machine placement (VMP). In this study, we consider a network-aware variant of the problem where the objective is to partition a virtual request so as to minimize the total amount of inter-cluster traffic. This problem is equivalent to the (k, v)-balanced partitioning problem, an NP-complete problem. To handle the inherent complexity of this problem, we develop a spectral clustering-based partitioning scheme that produces good solutions in a reasonable amount of time. Our solution consists of several components: (a) spectral clustering, (b) a Constrained k-means partitioning algorithm that ensures that capacity limits for clusters are met, and for which we present a polynomial-time greedy algorithm, and (c) a greedy refinement algorithm using simulated annealing to further improve the clustering solution. Simulation results indicate that our algorithm outperforms existing partitioning schemes in terms of inter-cluster traffic minimization. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We use percolation theory to develop a framework for studying the resilience of networks with a community structure. We find both analytically and numerically that interlinks (the connections among communities) affect the percolation phase transition in a way similar to an external field in a ferromagnetic- paramagnetic spin system. We also study universality class by defining the analogous critical exponents delta and gamma, and we find that their values in various models and in real-world coauthor networks follow the fundamental scaling relations found in physical phase transitions. The methodology and results presented here facilitate the study of network resilience and also provide a way to understand phase transitions under external fields.									5	0	0	1	0	5			0027-8424			WOS:000437107000047	29925594	J	Millan, Ana P.; Torres, Joaquin J.; Bianconi, Ginestra				Torres, Joaquin J./C-1385-2012	Torres, Joaquin J./0000-0001-6175-9676			Complex Network Geometry and Frustrated Synchronization								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						9910	10.1038/s41598-018-28236-w					JUL 2 2018	2018	The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators, and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral dimension of the network.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2045-2322			WOS:000436953900019	29967410	J	Hong, Siyang; Wang, Hongrui; Cheng, Tao					Cheng, Tao/0000-0002-5204-3470			Circulation Characteristic Analysis of Implied Water Flow Based on a Complex Network: A Case Study for Beijing, China								WATER				10	7					834	10.3390/w10070834					JUL 2018	2018	Water and energy are two indispensable resources in national economic production. Water is circulated among economic sectors through products or services; however, indirect water consumption calculated by the input output method fails to reflect the implied water utilised during energy consumption. This study combined the ecological input output method with a complex network model to analyse the embodied energy intensity (EEI) and the implied water intensity of embodied energy (IWIEE), and then constructed and analysed the implied water circulation network (IWCN) of 40 sectors in 2007, 2010, and 2012 in Beijing. The results indicate that the energy consumption of all of the sectors is mainly embodied in the transfer of the external provinces of China, and the variation trend of the implied water intensity of the embodied energy is consistent with the embodied energy intensity. The implied water circulation networks had small-world characteristics, indicating that water-saving effects in key sectors can quickly spread to other sectors. However, this may also result in a corresponding negative impact if water shortages occur in these sectors, due to the same spreading effect. The node strength, eigenvector centrality, key edge, and key indirect water flow path were selected as indicators to measure key sectors. Finally, water-saving measures and suggestions were proposed according to the complex network characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-4441			WOS:000442579700017		J	Alberto Fernandez-Zepeda, Jose; Brubeck-Salcedo, Daniel; Fajardo-Delgado, Daniel; Zatarain-Aceves, Hector				Fajardo-Delgado, Daniel/O-8541-2019	Fajardo-Delgado, Daniel/0000-0001-8215-5927; Zatarain Aceves, Hector/0000-0003-2899-2198			A Two-Player Coalition Cooperative Scheme for the Bodyguard Allocation Problem								JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				33	4			823	837		10.1007/s11390-018-1858-8					JUL 2018	2018	We address the bodyguard allocation problem (BAP), an optimization problem that illustrates the conflict of interest between two classes of processes with contradictory preferences within a distributed system. While a class of processes prefers to minimize its distance to a particular process called the root, the other class prefers to maximize it; at the same time, all the processes seek to build a communication spanning tree with the maximum social welfare. The two state-of-the-art algorithms for this problem always guarantee the generation of a spanning tree that satisfies a condition of Nash equilibrium in the system; however, such a tree does not necessarily produce the maximum social welfare. In this paper, we propose a two-player coalition cooperative scheme for BAP, which allows some processes to perturb or break a Nash equilibrium to find another one with a better social welfare. By using this cooperative scheme, we propose a new algorithm called FFC-BAP (S) for BAP. We present both theoretical and empirical analyses which show that this algorithm produces better quality approximate solutions than former algorithms for BAP.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-9000	1860-4749		WOS:000438683500014		J	Lee, Deokjae; Kahng, B.; Cho, Y.

While the percolation transition is known as one of the most robust continuous transitions, the percolation transitions occurring in complex systems are often of different types such as discontinuous, hybrid, and infinite-order phase transitions. Thus, percolation has received considerable attention in network science community. Here we present a very brief review of percolation theory recently developed, which includes those types of phase transitions, critical phenomena, and finite-size scaling theory. Moreover, we discuss potential applications of theoretical results and several open questions including universal behaviors.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0374-4884	1976-8524		WOS:000440159200002		J	Reis, Raquel Coelho; Goncalves, Eduardo; Taveira, Juliana Goncalves								Determinants of inventive collaborations in Brazilian interregional and international networks								REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE INOVACAO				17	2			287	316		10.20396/rbi.v17i2.8649987					JUL-DEC 2018	2018	The paper investigates the regional and structural determinants of the links in social networks of inventive collaboration among regions in Brazil. In order to do this, we make use of a patent applications database that registers collaborations among Brazilian inventors and Brazilian and foreign inventors. As possible determinants of the links in Brazilian co-patenting networks, we take into account variables that capture economic, technological, and demographic density aspects of Brazilian regions, as well as the topology structures of the nodes in the networks. The approach considers the Zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model, which considers the absolute number of interregional links among inventors from different regions. The formation of interregional patenting links was found to have been positively affected by the number of internal links to the region, by the number of inventors, by university and business R&D capacity, and mainly by the degree of centrality of the region. In the case of international networks formed between Brazilian and foreign inventors, the links are positively affected only by R&D capacity, especially industrial, and by the degree of centrality. In addition, the degree of internationalization of a network seems to positively affect the establishment of interregional networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1677-2504	2178-2822		WOS:000457371900003		J	Grech, Alana; Hanert, Emmanuel; McKenzie, Len; Rasheed, Michael; Thomas, Christopher; Tol, Samantha; Wang, Mingzhu; Waycott, Michelle; Wolter, Jolan; Coles, Rob					Hanert, Emmanuel/0000-0002-8359-868X; Grech, Alana/0000-0003-4117-3779; Coles, Robert/0000-0002-3192-3778			Predicting the cumulative effect of multiple disturbances on seagrass connectivity								GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY				24	7			3093	3104		10.1111/gcb.14127					JUL 2018	2018	The rate of exchange, or connectivity, among populations effects their ability to recover after disturbance events. However, there is limited information on the extent to which populations are connected or how multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass networks were densely connected, indicating that seagrasses are resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or more components was on average >245km, about half the length of the metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules; therefore, management should focus on improving environmental conditions that support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes. Our study provides a new framework for assessing the impact of global change on the connectivity and persistence of coastal and marine ecosystems. Without this knowledge, management actions, including coastal restoration, may prove unnecessary and be unsuccessful.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1354-1013	1365-2486		WOS:000437281500029	29543366	J	Su, Liju; Qian, Xiaodi; Yan, Ting					YAN, TING/0000-0001-9830-6646			A note on a network model with degree heterogeneity and homophily								STATISTICS & PROBABILITY LETTERS				138				27	30		10.1016/j.spl.2018.02.046					JUL 2018	2018	In this note, we establish a central limit theorem for the maximum likelihood estimator of the degree parameter in a network model with degree heterogeneity and homophily when the number of nodes goes to infinity.

For nonequal time-delays without noises, two situations are considered, where the conditions for synchronization, winnerless competition (WLC) and "two plus one" (TPO) are studied. In the first situation, if the C.) coupling strengths are the same, then the time-delays are set the same. WLC and synchronization are easy to occur in this situation, while TPO is hard to occur. In the second situation, if the distances between two neurons are the same, then the time-delays are set the same. The complementary phenomenon is found and discussed in detail for TPO to occur in this situation. Next, when common noise with equal time-delay r is added to the motifs, noise induced synchronization is compared for tau = 0 and tau = 2.7, where the motifs both exhibit WLC. When correlated noises with equal time-delay tau are added to the motifs, it is found that WLC is easier to be destroyed for tau = 2.7 than for tau = 0.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443596900004		J	Dutta, Ritabrata; Mira, Antonietta; Onnela, Jukka-Pekka								Bayesian inference of spreading processes on networks								PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES				474	2215					20180129	10.1098/rspa.2018.0129					JUL 2018	2018	Infectious diseases are studied to understand their spreading mechanisms, to evaluate control strategies and to predict the risk and course of future outbreaks. Because people only interact with few other individuals, and the structure of these interactions influence spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying transmission processes are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumours in a social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social/contact network in an Indian village and an online social network. Our goal is to learn simultaneously the spreading process parameters and the first infected node, given a fixed network structure and the observed state of nodes at several time points. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation, a likelihood-free inference technique. Our method is agnostic about the network topology and the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000440145500015	30100809	J	Armando Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo; Thong Pham				Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo/F-9512-2014; Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando/J-3354-2019	Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo/0000-0002-9049-8249; Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando/0000-0002-9049-8249; Pham, Thong/0000-0002-1940-9290			The evolutions of the rich get richer and the fit get richer phenomena in scholarly networks: the case of the strategic management journal								SCIENTOMETRICS				116	1			363	383		10.1007/s11192-018-2761-3					JUL 2018	2018	Understanding how a scientist develops new scientific collaborations or how their papers receive new citations is a major challenge in scientometrics. The approach being proposed simultaneously examines the growth processes of the co-authorship and citation networks by analyzing the evolutions of the rich get richer and the fit get richer phenomena. In particular, the preferential attachment function and author fitnesses, which govern the two phenomena, are estimated non-parametrically in each network. The approach is applied to the co-authorship and citation networks of the flagship journal of the strategic management scientific community, namely the Strategic Management Journal. The results suggest that the abovementioned phenomena have been consistently governing both temporal networks. The average of the attachment exponents in the co-authorship network is 0.30 while it is 0.29 in the citation network. This suggests that the rich get richer phenomenon has been weak in both networks. The right tails of the distributions of author fitness in both networks are heavy, which imply that the intrinsic scientific quality of each author has been playing a crucial role in getting new citations and new co-authorships. Since the total competitiveness in each temporal network is founded to be rising with time, it is getting harder to receive a new citation or to develop a new collaboration. Analyzing the average competency, it was found that on average, while the veterans tend to be more competent at developing new collaborations, the newcomers are likely better at acquiring new citations. Furthermore, the author fitness in both networks has been consistent with the history of the strategic management scientific community. This suggests that coupling node fitnesses throughout different networks might be a promising new direction in analyzing simultaneously multiple networks.									1	0	0	1	0	1			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000438126800016		J	Li, Yonghui; Wang, Kun; Gu, Huaxi; Yang, Yintang; Su, Nan; Chen, Yawen; Zhang, Haibo								A joint optimization method for NoC topology generation								JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING				74	7			2916	2934		10.1007/s11227-018-2339-0					JUL 2018	2018	The increasing demand on efficient intra-chip communication of multicore systems has driven the interconnection structure to evolve from bus/ring to Network-on-Chip (NoC). NoC design is fundamentally based on network topology generation and floorplanning. This paper proposes a joint optimization method to generate network topologies based on the floorplanning of heterogeneous IP cores for a given application-specific NoC. This method starts with clustering the heterogeneous IP cores according to their communication workloads using fuzzy clustering. It proceeds to apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the floorplanning by minimizing power consumption and/or chip area. By adding a router to each cluster of IP cores, network topologies are further generated via connecting routers based on the principles of scale-free networks. Experiments with a video processing application show that the optimized floorplanning of IP cores can be achieved by either minimizing the power consumption or chip area. An OPNET simulator is used to evaluate the performance of the NoC designed based on the proposed method. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance requirements of the application-specific NoC can be satisfied.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0920-8542	1573-0484		WOS:000437753700002		J	Gibson, Bill; Setterfield, Mark								Real and financial crises in the Keynes-Kalecki structuralist model: An agent-based approach								METROECONOMICA				69	3			566	592		10.1111/meca.12201					JUL 2018	2018	Agent-based models are inherently microstructureswith their attention to agent behavior in a field contextand only aggregate up to systems with recognizable macroeconomic characteristics. One might ask why the traditional Keynes-Kalecki or structuralist (KKS) model would bear any relationship to the multi-agent modeling approach. This paper shows how KKS models might benefit from agent-based microfoundations, without sacrificing traditional macroeconomic themes, such as aggregate demand, animal spirits and endogenous money. Above all, the integration of the two approaches gives rise to the possibility that a KKS systemstable over many consecutive time periodsmight lurch into an uncontrollable downturn, from which a recovery would require outside intervention. As a by-product of the integration of these two popular approaches, there emerges a cogent analysis of the network structure necessary to bind real and financial agents into an integrated whole. It is seen, contrary to much of the existing literature, that a highly connected financial system does not necessarily lead to more crashes of the integrated system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0026-1386	1467-999X		WOS:000436803900003		J	Meghanathan, Natarajan								delta-Space for real-world networks: A correlation analysis of decay centrality vs. degree centrality and closeness centrality								JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY-COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES				30	3			391	403		10.1016/j.jksuci.2017.04.006					JUL 2018	2018	We analyze a suite of 48 real-world networks and compute the decay centrality (DEC) of the vertices for the complete range of values for the decay parameter delta epsilon (0, 1) as well as determine the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) between the DEC delta values and degree centrality (DEG) and closeness centrality (CLC).

We show that the PCC(DEG, CLC) values for the real-world networks exhibit a very strongly positive correlation with the delta-space(r) values and demonstrate that one could predict the delta-space(r) value for a real-world network using the PCC(DEG, CLC) value for that network. We also analyze the impact of various topological measures on the delta-space(r) values for the real-world networks. (C) 2017 The Author.

On the basis of mean-field theory, the epidemic dynamics behavior of this model in a uniform network and a scale-free network is studied. After modifying the formula for the effective spread rate, we obtain the theoretical result that the coexistence of partial immunization and immune failure does not affect the network spread threshold. At the same time, the experimental results show that the existence of the above two conditions greatly increases the spread of the virus and extends the diffusion range. The study also found that in the scale-free network, peak viral infection occurs at the beginning of the spreading process, and after the immunization strategy is applied, the early infection peak is effectively curbed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1432-7643	1433-7479		WOS:000435598400002		J	Sesum-Cavic, Vesna; Kuehn, Eva; Zischka, Stefan								Swarm-Inspired Routing Algorithms for Unstructured P2P Networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SWARM INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH				9	3			23	63		10.4018/IJSIR.2018070102					JUL-SEP 2018	2018	Due to extreme complexity in nowadays networks, routing becomes a challenging task. This problem is especially delicate in unstructured P2P networks, as there is neither a global view on the network nor a global address mapping. Although different conventional solutions are commercially available, swarm-intelligent approaches are promising in case of frequently changing conditions in P2P networks. In this article, an approach inspired by Dictyostelium discoideum slime molds and bees with distributive and autonomous properties is proposed. Both bio-mechanisms are "tailored" for routing in unstructured P2P systems, resulting in swarm-inspired routing algorithms, SMNet and BeeNet. They are compared with three swarm-based routing algorithms and two conventional approaches. The benchmarks include parameter sensitivity -, comparative -, statistical - and scalability-analysis. SMNet outperforms the other algorithms in the comparative analysis regarding the average data packet delay, especially for bigger network sizes and data packet traffic levels. Both algorithms show good scalability.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1947-9263	1947-9271		WOS:000444731400002		J	Arioli, Mario; Benzi, Michele								A finite element method for quantum graphs								IMA JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS				38	3			1119	1163		10.1093/imanum/drx029					JUL 2018	2018	We study the numerical solution of boundary and initial value problems for differential equations posed on graphs or networks.

We describe and analyse the use of linear finite elements to discretize the spatial derivatives for a class of linear elliptic model problems. The solution of the discrete equations is discussed in detail in the context of a (nonoverlapping) domain decomposition approach. For model elliptic problems and a wide class of graphs, we show that a combination of Schur complement reduction and diagonally preconditioned conjugate gradients results in optimal complexity.

Gravity model estimation suggests that income elasticity for airborne trade at country level is 1.1, whereas the values for the three major economic zones are significantly higher. More importantly, we found that for China's international trade by air, the composition of economy is a more important driver than the size of economy. These results suggest that the Chinese air cargo sector will outpace the overall economic growth, with leading airports in the economic zones well-positioned to grow into major freight gateways. Air cargo demand in China was not as high as past GDP numbers suggested in the past, but is likely to experience sustained growth in the years to come. Network analysis suggests that cargo traffic volumes are concentrated in the catchments of metropolitan regions, where passenger hubs also serve as air cargo bases. However, domestic air freights currently mainly flow through a relatively small point-to-point network, suggesting that the leading airports are yet to become cargo gateway hubs despite their significant growth potential.

In this work, we report several scenarios where a first-order transition to synchronization occurs driven by the presence of a dependence between dynamics and network structure. Therefore, different mechanisms are shown to be able to prevent the formation of a giant synchronization cluster for sufficient large values of the coupling constant in both mono and multilayer networks. Using the Kuramoto model as a reference, we show how for an arbitrary network topology and frequency distribution, a very general weighting procedure acting on the weight of the links delays the synchronization transition forming independent synchronization clusters which suddenly merge above a critical threshold of the coupling constant. A completely different scenario in adaptive and multilayer networks is introduced which gives rise to the emergence of an explosive synchronization when a feedback between the dynamics and structure is operating by means of dependence links weighted through the order parameter.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1531-3492	1553-524X		WOS:000447274400005		J	Zhang, Dong-ming; Du, Fei; Huang, Hongwei; Zhang, Fan; Ayyub, Bilal M.; Beer, Michael					HUANG, Hong-Wei/0000-0001-6463-7869			Resiliency assessment of urban rail transit networks: Shanghai metro as an example								SAFETY SCIENCE				106				230	243		10.1016/j.ssci.2018.03.023					JUL 2018	2018	This paper presents a general framework to assess the resilience of large and complex metro networks by quantitatively analyzing its vulnerability and recovery rapidity within unifying metrics and models. The connectivity performance of network is indicated by the network efficiency. The resilience of a metro network can be associated to the network performance loss triangle over the relevant timeline from the occurrence of a random or intentional disruption to full recovery. The proposed resilience model is applied to the Shanghai metro network with its 303 stations and 350 links as an example. The quantitative vulnerability analysis shows that the Shanghai metro with its L-space type of topology has a strong robustness regarding connectivity under random disruption but severe vulnerability under intentional disruption. This result is typical for small-world and scale-free networks such as the Shanghai metro system, as can be shown by a basic topological analysis. Considering the case of one disrupted metro station, both the vulnerability and resilience of the network depend not only on the node degree of the disrupted station but also on its contribution to connectivity of the whole network. Analyzing the performance loss triangle and the associated cost from loss of operational income and repair measures, an appropriate recovery strategy in terms of the optimum recovery sequence of stations and the optimum duration can be identified in a structured manner, which is informative and helpful to decision makers.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0925-7535	1879-1042		WOS:000433267600022		J	Doostmohammadian, Mohammadreza; Rabiee, Hamid R.; Zarrabi, Houman; Khan, Usman								Observational Equivalence in System Estimation: Contractions in Complex Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING				5	3			212	224		10.1109/TNSE.2017.2746570					JUL-SEP 2018	2018	Observability of complex systems/networks is the focus of this paper, which is shown to be closely related to the concept of contraction. Indeed, for observable network tracking it is necessary/sufficient to have one node in each contraction measured. Therefore, nodes in a contraction are equivalent to recover for loss of observability, implying that contraction size is a key factor for observability recovery. Here, using a polynomial order contraction detection algorithm, we analyze the distribution of contractions, studying its relation with key network properties. Our results show that contraction size is related to network clustering coefficient and degree heterogeneity. Particularly, in networks with power-law degree distribution, if the clustering coefficient is high there are less contractions with smaller size on average. The implication is that estimation/tracking of such systems requires less number of measurements, while their observational recovery is more restrictive in case of sensor failure. Further, in Small-World networks higher degree heterogeneity implies that there are more contractions with smaller size on average. Therefore, the estimation of representing system requires more measurements, and also the recovery of measurement failure is more limited. These results imply that one can tune the properties of synthetic networks to alleviate their estimation/observability recovery.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2327-4697			WOS:000443761000004		J	Huang, Xiaodi; Huang, Changqin				Huang, Xiaodi/N-4427-2019	Huang, Xiaodi/0000-0002-6084-1851			NGD: Filtering Graphs for Visual Analysis								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIG DATA				4	3	SI		381	395		10.1109/TBDATA.2016.2555319					JUL-SEP 2018	2018	Graph visualization finds wide applications in different areas. As the popularity of social network sites is increasing, it becomes particularly useful in visual analysis of these sites. A number of algorithms for graph visualization have been developed over the past decades. The issue on how to design and develop algorithms by taking into account the characteristics of real graphs such as scale-free and hierarchical structures, however, has not been well addressed. In this paper, we extend the concept of a node degree to a node global degree for a node in a graph, and present an algorithm that computes their scores of all nodes. By taking advantage of the common structure features of real networks, two scalable extensions of this algorithm are further provided that are able to approximate computation results. Based on node global degrees, a filtering approach is presented to reduce the visual complexity of a layout. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithms in terms of two common evaluation metrics, as well as visualization results. In addition, we have implemented the algorithms in a prototype system, which enable users to explore a graph at continuous levels of details in real time, as evidenced by several real examples.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2332-7790			WOS:000443697900008		J	Peng Peng; Cheng Shifen; Chen Jinhai; Liao Mengdi; Wu Lin; Liu Xiliang; Lu Feng				Chen, Jinhai/F-5888-2014	Chen, Jinhai/0000-0002-7826-0414			A fine-grained perspective on the robustness of global cargo ship transportation networks								JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES				28	7			881	899		10.1007/s11442-018-1511-z					JUL 2018	2018	The robustness of cargo ship transportation networks is essential to the stability of the world trade system. The current research mainly focuses on the coarse-grained, holistic cargo ship transportation network while ignoring the structural diversity of different sub-networks. In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of the global cargo ship transportation network based on the most recent Automatic Identification System (AIS) data available. First, we subdivide three typical cargo ship transportation networks (i.e., oil tanker, container ship and bulk carrier) from the original cargo ship transportation network. Then, we design statistical indices based on complex network theory and employ four attack strategies, including random attack and three intentional attacks (i.e., degree-based attack, betweenness- based attack and flux-based attack) to evaluate the robustness of the three typical cargo ship transportation networks. Finally, we compare the integrity of the remaining ports of the network when a small proportion of ports lose their function. The results show that 1) compared with the holistic cargo ship transportation network, the fine-grain-based cargo ship transportation networks can fully reflect the pattern and process of global cargo transportation; 2) different cargo ship networks behave heterogeneously in terms of their robustness, with the container network being the weakest and the bulk carrier network being the strongest; and 3) small-scale intentional attacks may have significant influence on the integrity of the container network but a minor impact on the bulk carrier and oil tanker transportation networks. These conclusions can help improve the decision support capabilities in maritime transportation planning and emergency response and facilitate the establishment of a more reliable maritime transportation system.									4	0	0	0	0	4			1009-637X	1861-9568		WOS:000433356100002		J	Brenda, R.

The disordered system is studied through Monte Carlo simulations: the critical noise (T), as well as the critical exponents gamma/nu, beta/nu, and 1/nu for several values of the rewiring probability p. We find that this disordered system does not belong to the same universality class as the regular two-dimensional ferromagnetic model. The majority-vote model on directed small-world lattices presents in fact a second-order phase transition with new critical exponents which do not depend on p (0 < p < 1), but agree with the exponents of the equilibrium Ising model on directed small-world Voronoi-Delaunay random lattices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443596900013		J	Ding, Zhaogang; Dong, Yucheng; Kou, Gang; Palomares, Ivan; Yu, Shui				Dong, Yucheng/J-1668-2017	Dong, Yucheng/0000-0002-0028-6796; Palomares, Ivan/0000-0003-4335-9139			Consensus formation in opinion dynamics with online and offline interactions at complex networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	7					1850046	10.1142/S0129183118500468					JUL 2018	2018	Nowadays, with the development of information communication technology and Internet, more and more people receive information and exchange their opinions with others via online environments (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, Weibo, and WeChat). According to eMarketer Report [Worldwide Internet and Mobile Users: eMarketer's Updated Estimates and Forecast for 2015-2020 (eMarketer Report).

By contrast, the other half of the global population still obtain information and regularly exchange their opinions in a more traditional way (e.g. face to face). Generally, the speed at which information spreads and opinions are exchanged and updated in an online environment is much faster than in an offline environment. This paper focuses on jointly investigating the challenge of consensus formation in opinion dynamics with online and offline interactions. Without loss of generality, we assume the speed at which information spreads and opinions are exchanged and updated in an online environment is T (T is an element of N) times as fast as in an offline environment. We demonstrate that the update speed ratio in mixed online and offline environments (i.e. T) strongly impacts the consensus formation at complex networks: a large update speed ratio of online and offline environments (i.e. T) makes it difficult for all agents to reach consensus in opinion dynamics. Furthermore, these effects are often further intensified as the number of online participating agents increases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000443596900001		J	Barbero, Javier; Behrens, Kristian; Zofio, Jose L.

In models with a homogeneous sector, local market size is generally more strongly correlated with a country's industry share, whereas accessibility better explains a country's wage. We analytically show that result in a simplified case and then confirm it using simulations with random trading networks. In models with only differentiated sectors, both local market size and accessibility are highly correlated with wages. The impact of local market size on industry location is more robust than the impact of local market size on wages in economic geography models.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0166-0462	1879-2308		WOS:000441652500001		J	Brown, Kevin S.; Allopenna, Paul D.; Hunt, William R.; Steiner, Rachael; Saltzman, Elliot; McRae, Ken; Magnuson, James S.

The Neighborhood Activation Model posits that phonological neighbors (two forms [words] that differ by one phoneme) compete significantly for recognition as a spoken word is heard. This definition of phonological similarity can be extended to an entire corpus of forms to produce a phonological neighbor network (PNN). We study PNNs for five languages: English, Spanish, French, Dutch, and German. Consistent with previous work, we find that the PNNs share a consistent set of topological features. Using an approach that generates random lexicons with increasing levels of phonological realism, we show that even random forms with minimal relationship to any real language, combined with only the empirical distribution of language-specific phonological form lengths, are sufficient to produce the topological properties observed in the real language PNNs. The resulting pseudo-PNNs are insensitive to the level of lingustic realism in the random lexicons but quite sensitive to the shape of the form length distribution. We therefore conclude that universal features seen across multiple languages are really string universals, not language universals, and arise primarily due to limitations in the kinds of networks generated by the one-step neighbor definition. Taken together, our results indicate that caution is warranted when linking the dynamics of human spoken word recognition to the topological properties of PNNs, and that the investigation of alternative similarity metrics for phonological forms should be a priority.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000440017100046		J	Chen, Lei; Kou, Yingxin; Li, Zhanwu; Xu, An; Chang, Yizhe								Relationships between Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue and measurements of loops in networks								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				501				153	163		10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.180					JUL 1 2018	2018	The Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue (PFE) is widely used as measurement of the number of loops in networks, but what exactly the relationship between the PFE and the number of loops in networks is has not been researched yet, is it strictly monotonically increasing? And what are the relationships between the PFE and other measurements of loops in networks? Such as the average loop degree of nodes, and the distribution of loop ranks. We make researches on these questions based on samples of ER random network, NW small-world network and BA scale-free network, and the results confirm that, both the number of loops in network and the average loop degree of nodes of all samples do increase with the increase of the PFE in general trend, but neither of them are strictly monotonically increasing, so the PFE is capable to be used as a rough estimative measurement of the number of loops in networks and the average loop degree of nodes. Furthermore, we find that a majority of the loop ranks of all samples obey Weibull distribution, of which the scale parameter A and the shape parameter B have approximate power-law relationships with the PFE of the samples.

The random multi-hopper can jump to any node of the graph from an initial position, with a probability that decays as a function of the shortest-path distance between the two nodes in the graph. We consider here two decaying functions in the form of Laplace and Mellin transforms of the shortest-path distances. We prove that when the parameters of these transforms approach zero asymptotically, the hitting time in the multi-hopper approaches the minimum possible value for a normal random walker. We show by computational experiments that the multi-hopper explores a graph with clusters or skewed degree distributions more efficiently than a normal random walker. We provide computational evidences of the advantages of the random multi-hopper model with respect to the normal random walk by studying deterministic, random and real-world networks.									5	0	0	1	0	5			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000441314100004		J	Alvarez-Martinez, Roberto; Cocho, Germinal; Martinez-Mekler, Gustavo								Rank ordered beta distributions of nonlinear map symbolic dynamics families with a first-order transition between dynamical regimes								CHAOS				28	7					075515	10.1063/1.5027784					JUL 2018	2018	Rank-ordered distributions have been a matter of intense study. Often Zipf type invariant scaling is invoked; however, in the last decade the ubiquity of a Discrete Generalized Beta Distribution, DGBD, with two scaling exponents has been established. This distribution incorporates deviations from the power law at the extremes. A proper understanding of the meaning of these exponents is still lacking. Here, using two families of unimodal maps on the [0, 1] interval, we construct binary sequences via standard symbolic dynamics. In both cases, the tent map, which is at the convexconcave border of the mapping families, separates intermittent regimes from chaotic dynamics. We show that the frequencies of n-tuples of the generated symbolic sequences are remarkably well fitted by the DGBD. We argue that in the underlying dynamics an order-disorder competition takes place and that one of the exponents is related to multiple range correlations, while the other is sensitive to disorder. In our study, we implement thermodynamic formalisms with which we can readily calculate n-tuple frequencies, in some particular cases, analytically. We show that for the convex mappings there is a first-order thermodynamic phase transition, while concave mappings have smooth free energy densities. Within our DGBD study, the transition between these two regimes coincides with a zero value for both exponents; in this sense, they may even be considered as indicators of the transition. An analysis of the difference between the exponents reinforces the interpretation we have assigned to them. Furthermore, the two regimes can be identified by the sign of such a difference. We also show that divergences in the invariant densities are responsible for the first order phase transitions observed in a range of the rank-frequency distributions. Our findings give further support to previous studies based on expansion-modification algorithms, birth-death processes, and random variable subtraction dynamics.

Nodes in a graph representing a social network take turns generating words, leading to a symbolic time series associated with each node. Information propagates over the graph via a quoting mechanism, where nodes randomly copy short segments of text from each other. We characterize information flows from these text via information-theoretic estimators, and we derive analytic relationships between model parameters and the values of these estimators. We explore and validate the model with simulations on small network motifs and larger random graphs. Tractable models such as ours that generate symbolic data while controlling the information flow allow us to test and compare measures of information flow applicable to real social media data. In particular, by choosing different network structures, we can develop test scenarios to determine whether or not measures of information flow can distinguish between true and spurious interactions, and how topological network properties relate to information flow.

Although a vast amount of data on these interactions exists, this information is not compiled, integrated or easily searchable. Here we report immuneXpresso, a text-mining engine that structures and standardizes knowledge of immune intercellular communication. We applied immuneXpresso to PubMed to identify relationships between 340 cell types and 140 cytokines across thousands of diseases. The method is able to distinguish between incoming and outgoing interactions, and it includes the effect of the interaction and the cellular function involved. These factors are assigned a confidence score and linked to the disease. By leveraging the breadth of this network, we predicted and experimentally verified previously unappreciated cell-cytokine interactions. We also built a global immune-centric view of diseases and used it to predict cytokine-disease associations. This standardized knowledgebase (http://www.immunexpresso.org) opens up new directions for interpretation of immune data and model-driven systems immunology.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1087-0156	1546-1696		WOS:000438082000025	29912209	J	Duernecker, Georg; Vega-Redondo, Fernando								Social Networks and the Process of Globalization								REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STUDIES				85	3			1716	1751		10.1093/restud/rdx054					JUL 2018	2018	We propose a stylized dynamic model to understand the role of social networks in the phenomenon we call "globalization". In a nutshell, this term refers to the process by which even agents who are geographically far apart come to interact, thus being able to overcome what would otherwise be a fast saturation of local opportunities. Akey feature of our model is that the social network is the main channel through which agents exploit new opportunities. Therefore, only if the social network becomes global (heuristically, it "reaches far in few steps") can global interaction be steadily sustained. An important insight derived from the model is that, for the social network to turn global, the long-range links required (bridges) cannot endogenously arise unless the matching mechanism displays significant local structure (cohesion). This sheds novel light on the dichotomy between bridging and cohesion that has long played a prominent role in the socio-economic literature. Our analysis also relates the process of globalization to other features of the environment such as the quality of institutions or the arrival rate of fresh ideas. The model is partially studied analytically for a limit scenario with a continuum population and is fully solved numerically for finite-population contexts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0034-6527	1467-937X		WOS:000439714900010		J	Zhu, Zhi-Qiang								A novel method of generating tunable network topologies for social simulation								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										073410	10.1088/1742-5468/aace2f					JUL 2018	2018	The research of social networks has been paid more and more attention by scholars. In this paper, through the features of the establishment of the relationship between people in real social networks, we have proposed two new structural features, which can be seen an extension of the concept of clustering coeffcient. In view of these structural features, we have also proposed a new network evolution model which is similar to the formation process of social networks. Our model can generate a variety of networks which are similar to real social networks by adjusting some parameters. The new network model and topology features will help us to better study the related issues of social networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000439981900001		J	Ibnoulouafi, Ahmed; El Haziti, Mohamed; Cherifi, Hocine					IBNOULOUAFI, Ahmed/0000-0003-0834-6199			M-Centrality: identifying key nodes based on global position and local degree variation								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										073407	10.1088/1742-5468/aace08					JUL 2018	2018	Identifying influential nodes in a network is a major issue due to the great deal of applications concerned, such as disease spreading and rumor dynamics. That is why, a plethora of centrality measures has emerged over the years in order to rank nodes according to their topological importance in the network. Local metrics such as degree centrality make use of a very limited information and are easy to compute. Global metrics such as betweenness centrality exploit the information of the whole network structure at the cost of a very high computational complexity. Recent works have shown that combining multiple metrics is a promising strategy to quantify the node's influential ability. Our work is in this line. In this paper, we introduce a multi-attributes centrality measure called M-Centrality that combines the information on the position of the node in the network with the local information on its nearest neighborhood. The position is measured by the K-shell decomposition, and the degree variation in the neighborhood of the node quantifies the influence of the local context. In order to examine the performances of the proposed measure, we conduct experiments on small and large scale real-world networks from the perspectives of transmission dynamics and network connectivity. According to the empirical results, the M-Centrality outperforms its alternatives in identifying both influential spreaders and nodes essential to maintain the network connectivity. In addition, its low computational complexity makes it easily applied to large scale networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000439287300001		J	Lev-Ari, Shiri								Social network size can influence linguistic malleability and the propagation of linguistic change								COGNITION				176				31	39		10.1016/j.cognition.2018.03.003					JUL 2018	2018	We learn language from our social environment, but the more sources we have, the less informative each source is, and therefore, the less weight we ascribe its input. According to this principle, people with larger social networks should give less weight to new incoming information, and should therefore be less susceptible to the influence of new speakers. This paper tests this prediction, and shows that speakers with smaller social networks indeed have more malleable linguistic representations. In particular, they are more likely to adjust their lexical boundary following exposure to a new speaker. Experiment 2 uses computational simulations to test whether this greater malleability could lead people with smaller social networks to be important for the propagation of linguistic change despite the fact that they interact with fewer people. The results indicate that when innovators were connected with people with smaller rather than larger social networks, the population exhibited greater and faster diffusion. Together these experiments show that the properties of people's social networks can influence individuals' learning and use as well as linguistic phenomena at the community level.									4	0	0	2	0	4			0010-0277	1873-7838		WOS:000433641900003	29544113	J	Pu, Cunlai; Cui, Wei; Wu, Jiexin; Yang, Jian								Bufferless Transmission in Complex Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				65	7			893	897		10.1109/TCSII.2017.2775622					JUL 2018	2018	Complex bufferless networks such as on-chip networks and optical burst switching networks have not been paid enough attention in network science. In complex bufferless networks, the store and forward mechanism is not applicable, since the network nodes are not allowed to buffer data packets. In this brief, we study the data transmission process in complex bufferless networks from the perspective of network science. Specifically, we use the Price model to generate the underlying network topological structures. We propose a delivery queue based deflection mechanism, which accompanies the efficient routing protocol, to transmit data packets in bufferless networks. We investigate the average deflection times, packets loss rate, average arrival time, and how the network topological structure and some other factors affect these transmission performances. This brief provides some clues for the architecture and routing design of bufferless networks.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000437029000016		J	Zhao, Dawei; Gao, Bo; Wang, Yaofei; Wang, Lianhai; Wang, Zhen				Wang, Zhen/H-5017-2011	Wang, Zhen/0000-0002-8182-2852			Optimal Dismantling of Interdependent Networks Based on Inverse Explosive Percolation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				65	7			953	957		10.1109/TCSII.2018.2793257					JUL 2018	2018	Seeking nodes whose removal can effectively dismantle networks is closely related to the robustness of networks under targeted attacks or malicious software. Modern systems, such as critical infrastructure networks and cyber-physical systems, however, become increasingly dependent on others, which can be encapsulated into the framework of interdependent networks. In this brief, we focus on the optimal dismantling of interdependent networks, and propose a novel algorithm, named inverse explosive percolation (IEP), to find the optimal removal nodes. The IEP proceeds by first identifying the nodes which make the least contribution to the giant mutual connected cluster of interdependent networks. When nodes have the same contribution, the one with the smallest overlapping degree is selected. We apply the IEP algorithm to interdependent networks composed of real-world power grids, Internet networks and artificial networks, and find IEP performs much better than the existing methods in various kinds of networks. Based on its efficiency, IEP can be applied to large-scale systems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000437029000028		J	Ravkic, Irma; Znidarsic, Martin; Ramon, Jan; Davis, Jesse								Graph sampling with applications to estimating the number of pattern embeddings and the parameters of a statistical relational model								DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY				32	4			913	948		10.1007/s10618-018-0553-2					JUL 2018	2018	Counting the number of times a pattern occurs in a database is a fundamental data mining problem. It is a subroutine in a diverse set of tasks ranging from pattern mining to supervised learning and probabilistic model learning. While a pattern and a database can take many forms, this paper focuses on the case where both the pattern and the database are graphs (networks). Unfortunately, in general, the problem of counting graph occurrences is #P-complete. In contrast to earlier work, which focused on exact counting for simple (i.e., very short) patterns, we present a sampling approach for estimating the statistics of larger graph pattern occurrences. We perform an empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world data that validates the proposed algorithm, illustrates its practical behavior and provides insight into the trade-off between its accuracy of estimation and computational efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1384-5810	1573-756X		WOS:000435394100003		J	Shi, Q.

A three-dimensional network modeling method is presented, which includes the geometric effect of connectors and permits nonlinear dynamic analysis of the floating system. In the validation study, a three-modular floating platform model is fabricated for experimental test in wave basin. Both the linear model and nonlinear model of the network modeling method are examined in the collation of the hydro-elastic method and experiment test. The responses of modules and loads of connectors are employed for the comparison study. The results show that the linear model of the network modeling method is the closest to the test results and outperforms over the nonlinear model and the hydro-elastic method. The possible reasons of the discrepancy in the results of the different methods are discussed. This work validates that the network modeling method is reliable.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0378-3839	1872-7379		WOS:000432883500007		J	Maugis, Pierre-Andre G.								Big data uncertainties								JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE				57				7	11		10.1016/j.jflm.2016.09.005					JUL 2018	2018	Big data-the idea that an always-larger volume of information is being constantly recorded-suggests that new problems can now be subjected to scientific scrutiny. However, can classical statistical methods be used directly on big data? We analyze the problem by looking at two known pitfalls of big datasets. First, that they are biased, in the sense that they do not offer a complete view of the populations under consideration. Second, that they present a weak but pervasive level of dependence between all their components. In both cases we observe that the uncertainty of the conclusion obtained by statistical methods is increased when used on big data, either because of a systematic error (bias), or because of a larger degree of randomness (increased variance). We argue that the key challenge raised by big data is not only how to use big data to tackle new problems, but to develop tools and methods able to rigorously articulate the new risks therein.

Therefore, to study the propagation of "infection" across a social network, we propose a network epidemic model by combining a stochastic epidemic model and a preferential attachment model. A simulation study based on the subsequent Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm reveals an identifiability issue with the model parameters. Finally, the network epidemic model is applied to a set of online commissioning data.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0960-3174	1573-1375		WOS:000425545400010		J	Zeppini, Paolo; Frenken, Koen								Networks, Percolation, and Consumer Demand								JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION				21	3					1	10.18564/jasss.3658					JUN 30 2018	2018	Understanding diffusion processes is key to market strategies as well as innovation and sustainability policies. In promoting new products and technologies, firms and governments need to understand the conditions favouring successful spread of these products. We propose a generic diffiusion model based on percolation theory. Our reference is a new product diffusion in a social network through word-of-mouth. Given that consumers differ in their reservation prices, a critical price exists that defines a phase transition froma no-diffusion to a diffusion regime. As consumer surplus is maximised just below a product's critical price, one can systematically compare the economic efficiency of network structures by investigating their critical price. Networks with lowclustering were themost efficient, because clustering leads to redundant information flows hampering effective product diffusion. We further showed that the more equal a society, the more efficient the diffusion process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1460-7425			WOS:000439852500001		J	Dewhurst, David Rushing; Danforth, Christopher M.; Dodds, Peter Sheridan								Continuum rich-get-richer processes: Mean field analysis with an application to firm size								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				97	6					062317	10.1103/PhysRevE.97.062317					JUN 29 2018	2018	Classical rich-get-richer models have found much success in being able to broadly reproduce the statistics and dynamics of diverse real complex systems. These rich-get-richer models are based on classical urn models and unfold step by step in discrete time. Here, we consider a natural variation acting on a temporal continuum in the form of a partial differential equation (PDE). We first show that the continuum version of Simon's canonical preferential attachment model exhibits an identical size distribution. In relaxing Simon's assumption of a linear growth mechanism, we consider the case of an arbitrary growth kernel and find the general solution to the resultant PDE. We then extend the PDE to multiple spatial dimensions, again determining the general solution. We then relax the zero-diffusion assumption and find an envelope of solutions to the general model in the presence of small fluctuations. Finally, we apply the model to size and wealth distributions of firms. We obtain power-law scaling for both to be concordant with simulations as well as observational data, providing a parsimonious theoretical explanation for these phenomena.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000436938800009	30011449	J	Archbold, James; Griffiths, Nathan								Manipulating concept spread using concept relationships								PLOS ONE				13	6					e0199845	10.1371/journal.pone.0199845					JUN 28 2018	2018	The propagation of concepts in a population of agents is a form of influence spread, which can be modelled as a cascade from a set of initially activated individuals. The study of such influence cascades, in particular the identification of influential individuals, has a wide range of applications including epidemic control, viral marketing and the study of social norms. In real-world environments there may be many concepts spreading and interacting. These interactions can affect the spread of a given concept, either boosting it and allowing it to spread further, or inhibiting it and limiting its capability to spread. Previous work does not consider how the interactions between concepts affect concept spread. Taking concept interactions into consideration allows for indirect concept manipulation, meaning that we can affect concepts we are not able to directly control. In this paper, we consider the problem of indirect concept manipulation, and propose heuristics for indirectly boosting or inhibiting concept spread in environments where concepts interact. We define a framework that allows for the interactions between any number of concepts to be represented, and present a heuristic that aims to identify important influence paths for a given target concept in order to manipulate its spread. We compare the performance of this heuristic, called maximum probable gain, against established heuristics for manipulating influence spread.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000436645400081	29953556	J	Vespignani, Alessandro								Twenty years of network science								NATURE				558	7711			528	529		10.1038/d41586-018-05444-y					JUN 28 2018	2018										1	0	0	1	0	1			0028-0836	1476-4687		WOS:000436594300048	29941900	J	Ren, Yuanfang; Sarkar, Aisharjya; Kahveci, Tamer								ProMotE: an efficient algorithm for counting independent motifs in uncertain network topologies								BMC BIOINFORMATICS				19						242	10.1186/s12859-018-2236-9					JUN 26 2018	2018	Background: Identifying motifs in biological networks is essential in uncovering key functions served by these networks.

We utilize a polynomial model to capture the uncertainty. We develop three strategies to scale our algorithm to large networks.Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrate that our method scales to large networks in practical time with high accuracy where existing methods fail.

RDA introduces ancillary nodes to the given network following basic principles of minimal cost, density preservation, centrality reduction and randomness. First simulations over scale-free networks show that RDA gives a significant decreasing of both betweenness centrality and closeness centrality and hence topological protection of network is improved. On the other hand, the procedure is performed without significant change of the density of connections of the given network. Thus ancillae are not distinguible from real nodes (in a straightforward way) and hence network is obfuscated to potential adversaries by our manipulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2391-5455			WOS:000436195800001		J	Ali, Shahnawaz; Malik, Md Zubbair; Singh, Soibam Shyamchand; Chirom, Keilash; Ishrat, Romana; Singh, R.

The topological parameters (degree distributions, clustering co-efficient, connectivity and centralities) of this network obey fractal rules indicating absence of centrality lethality rule, and efficient communication among the components. From the network theoretical approach, we identified few key regulators out of large number of leading hubs, which are deeply rooted from top to down of the network, serve as backbone of the network, and possible target genes. However, p53, which is one of these key regulators, is found to be in low rank and keep itself at low profile but directly cross-talks with important genes BRCA2 and BRCA3. The popularity of these hubs gets changed in unpredictable way at various levels of organization thus showing disassortive nature. The local community paradigm approach in this network shows strong correlation of nodes in majority of modules/sub-modules (fast communication among nodes) and weak correlation of nodes only in few modules/sub-modules (slow communication among nodes) at various levels of network organization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000435802500023	29927945	J	Yang, Yujie; Zhang, Jianhua; Zhu, Xuzhen								Punishing the redundant influence improves the accuracy of link prediction								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	15					1850179	10.1142/S0217979218501795					JUN 20 2018	2018	The influence of traditionally composing node degree ignores the fact that effective transmission determines the similarity between endpoints in link prediction. Due to effective transmission, the degrees connected to the common neighbor and the short-path can be regarded as efficient influence, whereas the degrees connected to the noncommon neighbor and the long-path represent redundant influence because of their inefficiency, not to mention the paths disconnected to the target node. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new method based on punishing the redundant influence (PRI) to improve the accuracy of the link prediction by emphasizing the effective influence and increasing the similarity between node pairs. From the results of extensive experiments in twelve real-world networks, PRI achieves superior performance compared to the traditional methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000435581100001		J	Chen, Shuonan; Mar, Jessica C.

With single cell sequencing methods now becoming accessible, general network inference algorithms that were initially developed for data collected from bulk samples may not be suitable for single cells. Meanwhile, although methods that are specific for single cell data are now emerging, whether they have improved performance over general methods is unknown. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of five general methods and three single cell methods for inferring gene regulatory networks from both experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated data.Results: Standard evaluation metrics using ROC curves and Precision-Recall curves against reference sets sourced from the literature demonstrated that most of the methods performed poorly when they were applied to either experimental single cell data, or simulated single cell data, which demonstrates their lack of performance for this task. Using default settings, network methods were applied to the same datasets. Comparisons of the learned networks highlighted the uniqueness of some predicted edges for each method. The fact that different methods infer networks that vary substantially reflects the underlying mathematical rationale and assumptions that distinguish network methods from each other.Conclusions: This study provides a comprehensive evaluation of network modeling algorithms applied to experimental single cell gene expression data and in silico simulated datasets where the network structure is known. Comparisons demonstrate that most of these assessed network methods are not able to predict network structures from single cell expression data accurately, even if they are specifically developed for single cell methods. Also, single cell methods, which usually depend on more elaborative algorithms, in general have less similarity to each other in the sets of edges detected. The results from this study emphasize the importance for developing more accurate optimized network modeling methods that are compatible for single cell data. Newly-developed single cell methods may uniquely capture particular features of potential gene-gene relationships, and caution should be taken when we interpret these results.									6	0	0	5	0	6			1471-2105			WOS:000436130300001	29914350	J	Mocanu, Decebal Constantin; Mocanu, Elena; Stone, Peter; Nguyen, Phuong H.; Gibescu, Madeleine; Liotta, Antonio				; Liotta, Antonio/G-9532-2014	Mocanu, Decebal Constantin/0000-0002-5636-7683; Liotta, Antonio/0000-0002-2773-4421; Mocanu, Elena/0000-0002-0856-579X			Scalable training of artificial neural networks with adaptive sparse connectivity inspired by network science								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				9						2383	10.1038/s41467-018-04316-3					JUN 19 2018	2018	Through the success of deep learning in various domains, artificial neural networks are currently among the most used artificial intelligence methods. Taking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks (e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice) artificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here we propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an algorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erdos-Renyi random graph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during learning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers with sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of parameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional neural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets. Our approach has the potential to enable artificial neural networks to scale up beyond what is currently possible.									4	0	0	0	0	4			2041-1723			WOS:000435538500001	29921910	J	Jalili, Mandi					Jalili, Mahdi/0000-0002-0517-9420			Effective augmentation of networked systems and enhancing pinning controllability								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				500				155	161		10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.141					JUN 15 2018	2018	Controlling dynamics of networked systems to a reference state, known as pinning control, has many applications in science and engineering. In this paper, we introduce a method for effective augmentation of networked systems, while also providing high levels of pinning controllability for the final augmented network. The problem is how to connect a sub-network to an already existing network such that the pinning controllability is maximised. We consider the eigenratio of the augmented Laplacian matrix as a pinning controllability metric, and use graph perturbation theory to approximate the influence of edge addition on the eigenratio. The proposed metric can be effectively used to find the inter-network links connecting the disjoint networks. Also, an efficient link rewiring approach is proposed to further optimise the pinning controllability of the augmented network. We provide numerical simulations on synthetic networks and show that the proposed method is more effective than heuristic ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, an outstanding challenge is how to combine these complementary, yet partially disparate data sources to accurately identify tumor-specific gene products and clinical biomarkers. Here, we introduce inteGREAT for robust and scalable differential integration of high-throughput measurements. With inteGREAT, each data source is represented as a co-expression network, which is analyzed to characterize the local and global structure of each node across networks. inteGREAT scores the degree by which the topology of each gene in both transcriptome and proteome networks are conserved within a tumor type, yet different from other normal or malignant cells. We demonstrated the high performance of int eGREAT based on several analyses: deconvolving synthetic networks, rediscovering known diagnostic biomarkers, establishing relationships between tumor lineages, and elucidating putative prognostic biomarkers which we experimentally validated. Furthermore, we introduce the application of a dumpiness measure to quantitatively describe tumor lineage similarity. Together, inteGREAT not only infers functional and clinical insights from the integration of transcriptomic and proteomic data sources in cancer, but also can be readily applied to other heterogeneous high-throughput data sources. inteGREAT is open source and available t\o download from https://github. com/faryabib/inteGREAT.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000435403800001	29971090	J	da Silva, Roberto				da Silva, Roberto/O-1773-2019	da Silva, Roberto/0000-0001-6110-0441			Patterns of a spatial exploration under time evolution of the attractiveness: Persistent nodes, degree distribution, and spectral properties								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				500				60	71		10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.015					JUN 15 2018	2018	This work explores the features of a graph generated by agents that hop from one node to another node, where the nodes have evolutionary attractiveness. The jumps are governed by Boltzmann-like transition probabilities that depend both on the euclidean distance between the nodes and on the ratio (beta) of the attractiveness between them. It is shown that persistent nodes, i.e., nodes that never been reached by this special random walk are possible in the stationary limit differently from the case where the attractiveness is fixed and equal to one for all nodes (beta = 1). Simultaneously, one also investigates the spectral properties and statistics related to the attractiveness and degree distribution of the evolutionary network. Finally, a study of the crossover between persistent phase and no persistent phase was performed and it was also observed the existence of a special type of transition probability which leads to a power law behaviour for the time evolution of the persistence.

Hence, mitigating the impact of bogus rumors is of primary importance. This paper focuses on the problem of how to suppress a false rumor by use of the truth. Based on a set of rational hypotheses and a novel rumor-truth mixed spreading model, the effectiveness and cost of a rumor containing strategy are quantified, respectively. On this basis, the original problem is modeled as a constrained optimization problem (the RC model), in which the independent variable and the objective function represent a rumor-containing strategy and the effectiveness of a rumor-containing strategy, respectively. The goal of the optimization problem is to find the most effective rumor-containing strategy subject to a limited rumor containing budget. Some optimal rumor-containing strategies are given by solving their respective RC models. The influence of different factors on the highest cost effectiveness of a RC model is illuminated through computer experiments. The results obtained are instructive to develop effective rumor-containing strategies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

It is NP-hard, and receives more and more attention. Various methods have been proposed to solve the positive influence dominating set problem. However, most of the existing work focused on greedy algorithms, and the solution quality needs to be improved. In this paper, we formulate the minimum positive influence dominating set problem as an integer linear programming (ILP), and propose an ILP based memetic algorithm (ILPMA) for solving the problem. The ILPMA integrates a greedy randomized adaptive construction procedure, a crossover operator, a repair operator, and a tabu search procedure. The performance of ILPMA is validated on nine real-world social networks with nodes up to 36,692. The results show that ILPMA significantly improves the solution quality, and is robust.

A major drawback of the existing diversification models is that they do not consider redundancy elimination during the course of search, resulting in unassured novelty in the search result. In this paper, to improve the novelty of the search result, we propose a new method of diversified top-k similarity search by combining diversification of node attribute coverage with a dissimilarity constraint. Due to the non-monotonicity implied by the dissimilarity constraint, existing techniques based on monotonicity assumptions cannot be applied. Our model requires solving a new problem of Dissimilarity Constrained Non-monotone Submodular Maximization (DCNSM). Based on constructing a dissimilarity-based graph, we solve this problem by a greedy algorithm achieving an approximation ratio of 1/Delta, where Delta is the maximum node degree of the dissimilarity based graph, in time linear to the number of edges of the graph. We show that DCNSM cannot be approximated in ratio vertical bar V vertical bar(1-epsilon), indicating that our solution achieves an optimal ratio. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world attributed network datasets. The results show that our diversification model significantly outperforms the baseline methods, and confirm that combining dissimilarity constraint in diversification can significantly improve the novelty of search result.

The most basic of all the ranking techniques is based on nodes degree. While finding the degree of a node requires local information, ranking the node based on its degree requires global information, namely the degrees of all the nodes of the network. It is infeasible to collect the global information for some graphs such as (i) the ones emerging from big data, (ii) dynamic networks, and (iii) distributed networks in which the whole graph is not known. In this work, we propose methods to estimate the degree rank of a node, that are faster than the classical method of computing the centrality value of all nodes and then rank a node. The proposed methods are modeled based on the network characteristics and sampling techniques, thus not requiring the entire network. We show that approximately 1% node samples are adequate to find the rank of a node with high accuracy.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000435148000001		J	Fujiki, Yuka; Takaguchi, Taro; Yakubo, Kousuke								General formulation of long-range degree correlations in complex networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				97	6					062308	10.1103/PhysRevE.97.062308					JUN 11 2018	2018	We provide a general framework for analyzing degree correlations between nodes separated by more than one step (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in complex networks. One joint and four conditional probability distributions are introduced to fully describe long-range degree correlations with respect to degrees k and k' of two nodes and shortest path length l between them. We present general relations among these probability distributions and clarify the relevance to nearest-neighbor degree correlations. Unlike nearest-neighbor correlations, some of these probability distributions are meaningful only in finite-size networks. Furthermore, as a baseline to determine the existence of intrinsic long-range degree correlations in a network other than inevitable correlations caused by the finite-size effect, the functional forms of these probability distributions for random networks are analytically evaluated within a mean-field approximation. The utility of our argument is demonstrated by applying it to real-world networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000434765500007	30011590	J	Wang, Feifan; Zhang, Baihai; Chai, Senchun; Xia, Yuanqing								Community detection in complex networks using deep auto-encoded extreme learning machine								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	16					1850180	10.1142/S0217984918501804					JUN 10 2018	2018	Community detection has long been a fascinating topic in complex networks since the community structure usually unveils valuable information of interest. The prevalence and evolution of deep learning and neural networks have been pushing forward the advancement in various research fields and also provide us numerous useful and off the shelf techniques. In this paper, we put the cascaded stacked autoencoders and the unsupervised extreme learning machine (ELM) together in a two-level embedding process and propose a novel community detection algorithm. Extensive comparison experiments in circumstances of both synthetic and real-world networks manifest the advantages of the proposed algorithm. On one hand, it outperforms the k-means clustering in terms of the accuracy and stability thus benefiting from the determinate dimensions of the ELM block and the integration of sparsity restrictions. On the other hand, it endures smaller complexity than the spectral clustering method on account of the shrinkage in time spent on the eigenvalue decomposition procedure.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000434403700014		J	Millan, Ana P.; Torres, J.

We study this interplay by combining a familiar auto-associative neural network with an evolving mechanism for the birth and death of synapses. A feedback loop then arises leading to two qualitatively different types of behaviour. In one, the network structure becomes heterogeneous and dissasortative, and the system displays good memory performance; furthermore, the structure is optimised for the particular memory patterns stored during the process. In the other, the structure remains homogeneous and incapable of pattern retrieval. These findings provide an inspiring picture of brain structure and dynamics that is compatible with experimental results on early brain development, and may help to explain synaptic pruning. Other evolving networks-such as those of protein interactions-might share the basic ingredients for this feedback loop and other questions, and indeed many of their structural features are as predicted by our model.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2041-1723			WOS:000434644200012	29884799	J	Wang, Chengmin; Lyu, Nan; Deng, Lingling; Wang, Jing; Gu, Wenwen; Ding, Hua; Wu, Yan; Luo, Jing; Wang, Liang; Lyv, Xueze; Liu, Xiaodong; Tao, Yi; He, Hongxuan								Evolutionary Pattern and Large-Scale Architecture of Mutation Networks of 2009 A (H1N1) Influenza A Virus								FRONTIERS IN GENETICS				9						204	10.3389/fgene.2018.00204					JUN 7 2018	2018	The adaptive evolution of influenza virus is an important question, but predicting its evolutionary future will be more challenging. Here, we investigated the mutation characteristic of influenza virus based on the complete genome data of 2009 (H1N1) influenza A virus. By assuming that evolution proceeds via the accumulation of mutations, we analyzed the mutation networks at four different time stages and found that the network structure follows the characteristics of a scale-free network. These results will be important for epidemiology and the future control of influenza viruses. Furthermore, we predicted the predominant mutation virus strain by using the early mutation network of influenza viruses, and this result was consistent with the WHO recommendation for the candidate vaccine of influenza virus. The key contribution of this study is that we explained the biological significance of this scale-free network for influenza pandemic and provided a potential method for predicting the candidate vaccine by using the early-stage network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000434430300001	29951084	J	Leyva, I.; Sendina-Nadal, I.; Sevilla-Escoboza, R.; Vera-Avila, V.

In this work, we report a systematic study of this phenomenon in multiplex networks, where inter-layer synchronization occurs between distant layers mediated by a relay layer that acts as a transmitter. We show that this transmission can be extended to higher order relay configurations, provided symmetry conditions are preserved. By first order perturbative analysis, we identify the dynamical and topological dependencies of relay synchronization in a multiplex. We find that the relay synchronization threshold is considerably reduced in a multiplex configuration, and that such synchronous state is mostly supported by the lower degree nodes of the outer layers, while hubs can be de-multiplexed without affecting overall coherence. Finally, we experimentally validated the analytical and numerical findings by means of a multiplex of three layers of electronic circuits.									5	0	0	0	0	5			2045-2322			WOS:000434122600054	29872135	J	Samal, Areejit; Sreejith, R.

Importantly, these two discretizations of the Ricci curvature were developed based on different properties of the classical smooth notion, and thus, the two notions shed light on different aspects of network structure and behavior. Nevertheless, our extensive computational analysis in a wide range of both model and real-world networks shows that the two discretizations of Ricci curvature are highly correlated in many networks. Moreover, we show that if one considers the augmented Forman-Ricci curvature which also accounts for the two-dimensional simplicial complexes arising in graphs, the observed correlation between the two discretizations is even higher, especially, in real networks. Besides the potential theoretical implications of these observations, the close relationship between the two discretizations has practical implications whereby Forman-Ricci curvature can be employed in place of Ollivier-Ricci curvature for faster computation in larger real-world networks whenever coarse analysis suffices.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000434122600075	29872167	J	Mei, Zhenning; Zhao, Xian; Chen, Hongyu; Chen, Wei								Bio-Signal Complexity Analysis in Epileptic Seizure Monitoring: A Topic Review								SENSORS				18	6					1720	10.3390/s18061720					JUN 2018	2018	Complexity science has provided new perspectives and opportunities for understanding a variety of complex natural or social phenomena, including brain dysfunctions like epilepsy. By delving into the complexity in electrophysiological signals and neuroimaging, new insights have emerged. These discoveries have revealed that complexity is a fundamental aspect of physiological processes. The inherent nonlinearity and non-stationarity of physiological processes limits the methods based on simpler underlying assumptions to point out the pathway to a more comprehensive understanding of their behavior and relation with certain diseases. The perspective of complexity may benefit both the research and clinical practice through providing novel data analytics tools devoted for the understanding of and the intervention about epilepsies. This review aims to provide a sketchy overview of the methods derived from different disciplines lucubrating to the complexity of bio-signals in the field of epilepsy monitoring. Although the complexity of bio-signals is still not fully understood, bundles of new insights have been already obtained. Despite the promising results about epileptic seizure detection and prediction through offline analysis, we are still lacking robust, tried-and-true real-time applications. Multidisciplinary collaborations and more high-quality data accessible to the whole community are needed for reproducible research and the development of such applications.									2	0	0	2	0	2			1424-8220			WOS:000436774300054	29861451	J	Colombo, Matteo; Weinberger, Naftali								Discovering Brain Mechanisms Using Network Analysis and Causal Modeling								MINDS AND MACHINES				28	2	SI		265	286		10.1007/s11023-017-9447-0					JUN 2018	2018	Mechanist philosophers have examined several strategies scientists use for discovering causal mechanisms in neuroscience. Findings about the anatomical organization of the brain play a central role in several such strategies. Little attention has been paid, however, to the use of network analysis and causal modeling techniques for mechanism discovery. In particular, mechanist philosophers have not explored whether and how these strategies incorporate information about the anatomical organization of the brain. This paper clarifies these issues in the light of the distinction between structural, functional and effective connectivity. Specifically, we examine two quantitative strategies currently used for causal discovery from functional neuroimaging data: dynamic causal modeling and probabilistic graphical modeling. We show that dynamic causal modeling uses findings about the brain's anatomical organization to improve the statistical estimation of parameters in an already specified causal model of the target brain mechanism. Probabilistic graphical modeling, in contrast, makes no appeal to the brain's anatomical organization, but lays bare the conditions under which correlational data suffice to license reliable inferences about the causal organization of a target brain mechanism. The question of whether findings about the anatomical organization of the brain can and should constrain the inference of causal networks remains open, but we show how the tools supplied by graphical modeling methods help to address it.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-6495	1572-8641		WOS:000435363900003	30996522	J	Valenzuela Castellanos, Marco F.; Perez Villalobos, M.

Outcomes show the replacement of 50% of the words mentioned between the two observations, while lexical graphs show similar structural characteristics to those built with large databases. Changes observed in lexical availability and words connectivity show the passage of a concept of learning based on teaching, to one based on internal processes of the learner.

Metric indicators are then introduced to measure the network, and the economic meanings of the indicators are discussed. By integrating time windows with the network model, three types of network features are examined: growth features, structural features, and scale-free features. The growth pattern of the carbon trading network is then analyzed. As the market grow, the geodesic distances become shorter and the clustering coefficients become larger. The trends of these two indicators suggest that the market is evolving towards efficiency; however, their tiny changes are insufficient to have significant impact. By modeling the heterogeneity of the carbon trading network, we find that the trading relationships between firms obey a broken power law model, which consists of two power law models. The broken power law model can be approximately defined as a traditional power law but with a longer tail in distribution. Furthermore, we find that the model is valid for most of the time of both phases, the model only invalid when the market approaches a high growth rate.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1073			WOS:000436552700179		J	Marc, Tilen; Subelj, Lovro				Subelj, Lovro/V-9106-2018	Subelj, Lovro/0000-0002-4161-2260			Convexity in complex networks								NETWORK SCIENCE				6	2			176	203		10.1017/nws.2017.37					JUN 2018	2018	Metric graph properties lie in the heart of the analysis of complex networks, while in this paper we study their convexity through mathematical definition of a convex subgraph. A subgraph is convex if every geodesic path between the nodes of the subgraph lies entirely within the subgraph. According to our perception of convexity, convex network is such in which every connected subset of nodes induces a convex subgraph. We show that convexity is an inherent property of many networks that is not present in a random graph. Most convex are spatial infrastructure networks and social collaboration graphs due to their tree-like or clique-like structure, whereas the food web is the only network studied that is truly non-convex. Core-periphery networks are regionally convex as they can be divided into a non-convex core surrounded by a convex periphery. Random graphs, however, are only locally convex meaning that any connected subgraph of size smaller than the average geodesic distance between the nodes is almost certainly convex. We present different measures of network convexity and discuss its applications in the study of networks.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2050-1242	2050-1250		WOS:000433948000002		J	Tylianakis, Jason M.; Martinez-Garcia, Laura B.; Richardson, Sarah J.; Peltzer, Duane A.; Dickie, Ian A.

Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120000year soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and, in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions and suggesting trajectories for restoration.									3	0	0	3	0	3			1461-023X	1461-0248		WOS:000431987100013	29611321	J	Soni, Utkarsh; Lu, Yafeng; Hansen, Brett; Purchase, Helen C.; Kobourov, Stephen; Maciejewski, Ross				Kobourov, Stephen G/A-3016-2008	Kobourov, Stephen G/0000-0002-0477-2724			The Perception of Graph Properties in Graph Layouts								COMPUTER GRAPHICS FORUM				37	3			169	181		10.1111/cgf.13410					JUN 2018	2018	When looking at drawings of graphs, questions about graph density, community structures, local clustering and other graph properties may be of critical importance for analysis. While graph layout algorithms have focused on minimizing edge crossing, symmetry, and other such layout properties, there is not much known about how these algorithms relate to a user's ability to perceive graph properties for a given graph layout. In this study, we apply previously established methodologies for perceptual analysis to identify which graph drawing layout will help the user best perceive a particular graph property. We conduct a large scale (n = 588) crowdsourced experiment to investigate whether the perception of two graph properties (graph density and average local clustering coefficient) can be modeled using Weber's law. We study three graph layout algorithms from three representative classes (Force Directed - FD, Circular, and Multi-Dimensional Scaling - MDS), and the results of this experiment establish the precision of judgment for these graph layouts and properties. Our findings demonstrate that the perception of graph density can be modeled with Weber's law. Furthermore, the perception of the average clustering coefficient can be modeled as an inverse of Weber's law, and the MDS layout showed a significantly different precision of judgment than the FD layout.					20th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization (EuroVis)20th Eurographics/IEEE VGTC Conference on Visualization (EuroVis)	JUN 04-08, 2018JUN 04-08, 2018	IEEE Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; Univ Masarykiana, Fac Artis Informatice; Univ Masarykiana Brunensis; European Assoc Com Graph; Nvidia; Intel; King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol; Kiwi Com; A V MediaIEEE Visualizat & Graph Tech Comm; Univ Masarykiana, Fac Artis Informatice; Univ Masarykiana Brunensis; European Assoc Com Graph; Nvidia; Intel; King Abdullah Univ Sci & Technol; Kiwi Com; A V Media	Brno, CZECH REPUBLICBrno, CZECH REPUBLIC	0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-7055	1467-8659		WOS:000438024300017		J	Muellner, Ulrich; Fournie, Guillaume; Muellner, Petra; Ahlstrom, Christina; Pfeiffer, Dirk U.

During recent public and animal health crises, such as pandemic influenza, Ebola, Zika, foot-and-mouth disease, models have made important contributions in addressing policy questions, especially through the assessment of the trajectory and scale of outbreaks, and the evaluation of control interventions. However, their mathematical formulation means that they may appear as a "black box" to those without the appropriate mathematical background. This may lead to a negative perception of their utility for guiding policy, and generate expectations, which are not in line with what these models can deliver. It is therefore important for policymakers, as well as public health and animal health professionals and researchers who collaborate with modelers and use results generated by these models for policy development or research purpose, to understand the key concepts and assumptions underlying these models.The software application epidemix (http://shinyapps.rvc.ac.uk) presented here aims to make mathematical models of disease transmission accessible to a wider audience of users. By developing a visual interface for a suite of eight models, users can develop an understanding of the impact of various modelling assumptions especially mixing patterns - on the trajectory of an epidemic and the impact of control interventions, without having to directly deal with the complexity of mathematical equations and programming languages. Models are compartmental or individual-based, deterministic or stochastic, and assume homogeneous or heterogeneous-mixing patterns (with the probability of transmission depending on the underlying structure of contact networks, or the spatial distribution of hosts). This application is intended to be used by scientists teaching mathematical modelling short courses to non-specialists - including policy makers, public and animal health professionals and students - and wishing to develop hands-on practicals illustrating key concepts of disease dynamics and control.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1755-4365			WOS:000433291200006	29273280	J	Narang, Rishabh; Sarin, Simran; Singh, Prajjwal; Goyal, Rinkaj				Goyal, Rinkaj/H-2711-2019	Goyal, Rinkaj/0000-0002-4380-4012; Narang, Rishabh/0000-0003-3036-1424			Impact of Reciprocity in Information Spreading Using Epidemic Model Variants								INFORMATION				9	6					136	10.3390/info9000136					JUN 2018	2018	The use of online social networks has become a standard medium of social interactions and information spreading. Due to the significant amount of data available online, social network analysis has become apropos to the researchers of diverse domains to study and analyse innovative patterns, friendships, and relationships. Message dissemination through these networks is a complex and dynamic process. Moreover, the presence of reciprocal links intensify the whole process of propagation and expand the chances of reaching to the target node. We therefore empirically investigated the relative importance of reciprocal relationships in the directed social networks affecting information spreading. Since the dynamics of the information diffusion has considerable qualitative similarities with the spread of infections, we analysed six different variants of the Susceptible-Infected (SI) epidemic spreading model to evaluate the effect of reciprocity. By analysing three different directed networks on different network metrics using these variants, we establish the dominance of reciprocal links as compared to the non-reciprocal links. This study also contributes towards a closer examination of the subtleties responsible for maintaining the network connectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2078-2489			WOS:000436151900008		J	Dunning, Iain; Gupta, Swati; Silberholz, John								What Works Best When?

In a systematic review of Max-Cut and quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) heuristics papers, we found only 4% publish source code, only 14% compare heuristics with identical termination criteria, and most experiments are performed with an artificial, homogeneous set of problem instances. To address these limitations, we implement and release as open-source a code-base of 10 Max-Cut and 27 QUBO heuristics. We perform heuristic evaluation using cloud computing on a library of 3,296 instances. This large-scale evaluation provides insight into the types of problem instances for which each heuristic performs well or poorly. Because no single heuristic outperforms all others across all problem instances, we use machine learning to predict which heuristic will work best on a previously unseen problem instance, a key question facing practitioners.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1091-9856	1526-5528		WOS:000449096000013		J	Yang Yinghui; Li Jianhua; Shen Di; Nan Mingli; Cui Qiong								Evolutionary dynamics analysis of complex network with fusion nodes and overlap edges								JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS				29	3			549	559		10.21629/JSEE.2018.03.12					JUN 2018	2018	Multiple complex networks, each with different properties and mutually fused, have the problems that the evolving process is time varying and non-equilibrium, network structures are layered and interlacing, and evolving characteristics are difficult to be measured. On that account, a dynamic evolving model of complex network with fusion nodes and overlap edges (CNFNOEs) is proposed. Firstly, we define some related concepts of CNFNOEs, and analyze the conversion process of fusion relationship and hierarchy relationship. According to the property difference of various nodes and edges, fusion nodes and overlap edges are subsequently split, and then the CNFNOEs is transformed to interlacing layered complex networks (ILCN). Secondly, the node degree saturation and attraction factors are defined. On that basis, the evolution algorithm and the local world evolution model for ILCN are put forward. Moreover, four typical situations of nodes evolution are discussed, and the degree distribution law during evolution is analyzed by means of the mean field method. Numerical simulation results show that nodes unreached degree saturation follow the exponential distribution with an error of no more than 6%; nodes reached degree saturation follow the distribution of their connection capacities with an error of no more than 3%; network weaving coefficients have a positive correlation with the highest probability of new node and initial number of connected edges. The results have verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the model, which provides a new idea and method for exploring CNFNOE's evolving process and law. Also, the model has good application prospects in structure and dynamics research of transportation network, communication network, social contact network, etc.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1004-4132			WOS:000437777600012		J	Filho, Francisco Conrado; Santos, Luís António								Potencialidades e limitações da metodologia de análise de rede: um modelo teórico voltado para as Ciências Sociais	Potentialities and limitations of network analysis methodologies: a theoretical model focused on the Social Sciences							Comunicação e Sociedade				33	0			183	198		10.17231/comsoc.33(2018).2913					2018-06	2018	This paper explores the potentialities and limitations of network analysis, not only as a methodological tool that may be used in Social Science research but also as a separate discipline, with its own well-tested theories. Providing a framework for the use of network analysis involves discussing the role that it can play in understanding objects using a field that is sometimes accused of being too technical. Despite the fact that it has increased in popularity over recent years, driven by new communication technologies and especially social media channels, network analysis has a much broader use, and we therefore aim to demonstrate some innovative approaches that may be used in Social Science research. Finally, because it is an interdisciplinary methodology, we discuss some of the associated risks and biases.		Este artigo procura discutir o lugar da análise de rede dentro das Ciências Sociais, não somente como uma simples ferramenta de investigação metodológica, mas também na perspetiva de um campo de investigação com teorias próprias e consolidadas. Enquadrar a sua utilização significa discutir o seu papel na análise e compreensão de objetos por um campo que sofre, às vezes, acusações de ser bastante tecnicista. Apesar de impulsionado pelas novas tecnologias de comunicação e pelos média sociais, em particular, a análise de rede tem um espectro de utilização muito mais alargado, pelo que pretendemos apresentar algumas das abordagens possíveis na investigação em Ciências Sociais.

WDNs can be regarded as large sparse planar graphs showing fractal and complex network properties. In this paper, the relationship linking the geometrical and topological features of a WDN to its resilience to the failure of a pipe is investigated. Some innovative indices have been borrowed from fractal geometry and complex network theory to study WDNs. Considering all possible network configurations obtained by suppressing one link, the proposed indices are used to quantify the impact of pipe failure on the system's resilience. This approach aims to identify critical links, in terms of resilience, with the help of topological metrics only, and without recourse to hydraulic simulations, which require complex calibration processes and come with a computational burden. It is concluded that the proposed procedure, which has been successfully tested on two real WDNs located in southern Italy, can provide valuable information to water utilities about which pipes have a significant role in network performance, thus helping in their design, planning and management.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1606-9749			WOS:000437347600003		J	Fotuhi, Hatef; Amiri, Amirhossein; Maleki, Mohammad Reza				Amiri, Amirhossein/P-8484-2014	Amiri, Amirhossein/0000-0002-2385-8910			Phase I monitoring of social networks based on Poisson regression profiles								QUALITY AND RELIABILITY ENGINEERING INTERNATIONAL				34	4			572	588		10.1002/qre.2273					JUN 2018	2018	Nowadays, due to the increasing role of social networks in our daily life, monitoring and forecasting social trends have attracted the attention of many researchers. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the literature includes few studies of monitoring social networks. Existing researches have focused on analyzing only the existence of communications between people and have neglected to monitor the number of such communications. In this paper, first counts of communications between people are modeled using Poisson regression profiles. Then, 3 Phase I monitoring methods, extended T-2, F, and a standardized likelihood ratio test method is suggested to detect step changes, drift, and outliers in the parameters of Poisson regression profiles. The proposed methods are evaluated via simulation studies in terms of signal probability criterion. The results show that in most out-of-control situations the standardized likelihood ratio test method outperforms the T-2 and F methods. Then, a numerical example and a case study based on Enron email data are presented to illustrate the application of the extended methods.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0748-8017	1099-1638		WOS:000434171700007		J	Shang, Jin; Wang, Ruizhe; Xin, Chen; Dai, Gaole; Huang, Jiping								Macroscopic networks of thermal conduction: Failure tolerance and switching processes								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER				121				321	328		10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2018.01.011					JUN 2018	2018	The world is so wonderful and colorful thanks to the analytic discontinuities and singularities of phase transitions. Here we propose a class of macroscopic networks of thermal conduction that combine regular networks with macroscopic thermally conductive systems. We find that their phase transition phenomena (variation tendency) cannot be explained simultaneously by existing theories of networks, percolation or effective media. We report the bond-free property of these networks and the associated three switching processes caused by the geometric property of bonds, and we reveal the effect of single point connection. Also, we propose some potential applications including thermal diodes. Our results are confirmed by finite-element method simulation and experiment. This work offers different insights into the theories of networks, percolation and effective media. It also provides a different method to design thermal metamaterials and manipulate thermal conductivities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Critical arcs detection in influence networks								NETWORKS				71	4	SI		412	431		10.1002/net.21761					JUN 2018	2018	The influence class of network problems models the propagation of influence (an abstraction of cascading beliefs, behaviors, or physical phenomena) in a network. Such problems have applications in social networks, electrical networks, computer networks, viral spreading, and so on. These types of networks have also been studied through the lens of critical arcs detection; that is, which arcs (edges) are the most important for maintaining some property of the network (e.g., connectivity). We introduce a new class of problems at the intersection of these two models. Specifically, given a set of seed nodes and the linear threshold influence propagation model, our work proposes to determine which arcs (e.g., relationships in a social network or communication pathways in a telecommunication network) are most critical to the influence propagation process. We prove NP-hardness of the problem. Time-dependent and time-independent mixed-integer programming (MIP) models are introduced. Insights gleaned from MIP solutions leads to the development of an improved MIP-based exact algorithm rooted in the idea of diffusion expansion. A heuristic based upon a new centrality measure is also proposed, and computational results are presented. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and fascinating problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. Dynamic networks can be used to model the evolution of a system: nodes and edges are mutable, and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them.This survey aims to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery and propose a classification of published approaches. As a "user manual," this work organizes state-of-the-art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instantiation. Given a definition of network dynamics, desired community characteristics, and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs. The proposed classification could also help researchers choose in which direction to orient their future research.									9	0	0	1	0	9			0360-0300	1557-7341		WOS:000434678500013		J	Demeter, Marton				Demeter, Marton/J-8004-2019				The Global South's Participation in the International Community of Communication Scholars: From an Eastern European Point of View								PUBLISHING RESEARCH QUARTERLY				34	2			238	255		10.1007/s12109-018-9585-0					JUN 2018	2018	In this paper, we present the Eastern European (EE) region as part of the Global South with all its disadvantages, and we will argue that "Sovietization" of the region is, in many respects, similar to the colonization of different world regions. We also show that the disadvantages of the region still exist after the transition, and EE has an especially low contribution to communication and media studies (CMS). With a brief bibliometric analysis in CMS, the paper demonstrates that a strong bias holds against EE authors and editorial board members in leading periodicals in CMS, and at least 95% of EE research remains unnoticed by international scholars. We further argue that this phenomenon is obviously harmful to the field of CMS. This paper not only points out the general difficulties Eastern European communication scholars might face when trying to make their research internationally visible, but it also snatches at the chance to introduce a novel, a respected but internationally yet unnoticed Easter European (Hungarian) communication theory, namely, the Participation Theory of Communication.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1053-8801	1936-4792		WOS:000441197000005		J	Ju, Zhichao; Ma, Jinlong; Xie, Jianjun; Qi, Zhaohui								Cascading failure model for improving the robustness of scale-free networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C				29	6					1850044	10.1142/S0129183118500444					JUN 2018	2018	To control the spread of cascading failure on scale-free networks, we propose a new model with the betweenness centrality and the degrees of the nodes which are combined. The effects of the parameters of the edge weight on cascading dynamics are investigated. Five metrics to evaluate the robustness of the network are given: the threshold parameter (T-C), the proportion of collapsed edges (CFE), the proportion of collapsed nodes (CFN), the number of nodes in the largest connected component (S-G) and the number of the connected component (S-C). Compared with the degrees of nodes' model and the betweenness of the nodes' model, the new model could control the spread of cascading failure more significantly. This work might be helpful for preventing and mitigating cascading failure in real life, especially for small load networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000437316200006		J	Li, Jinqiang; Zhou, Shuming; Li, Xuequn; Li, Xiaowang								An insertion-deletion-compensation model with Poisson process for scale-free networks								FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				83				425	430		10.1016/j.future.2017.04.011					JUN 2018	2018	A novel insertion-deletion-compensation model with Poisson process for the scale-free complex network is explored. In the proposed model, a batch of newly added nodes are inserted into the network with the rate at A under Poisson process and each new node is connected to some old nodes. Meanwhile, old nodes are possibly deleted due to aging or being attacked at each evolving time step. Furthermore, with a given probability, some additional links are preferentially incident to the nodes with better activity in the latest evolving periods. By mean field approach, we shows that the stationary mean degree distribution is a power-law distribution, and the power-law exponent is flexible and ranges from 1 to 3. By the aid of moment estimation in probability theory, we distinguish the convergence of node degree. Our theoretical result shows that the degree distribution and the power-law exponent of complex networks are kept unchanged and independent to the evolving time when the input rate and connections of individuals are not considered.

Moreover, we find the non-trivial influence of the extortion factor on the evolution of cooperation, which implies that there exists an optimal value of the extortion factor with which the cooperation-extortion alliance is mostly favored and may defeat defectors on the networks with the normalized payoff framework.

The aim is to simulate the concentration of air pollutants emitted from sources (e.g. factories) and to investigate the emergence of cooperation between the emission source managers and the impact this has on air quality. The emission sources are controlled by agents. The agents try to achieve their goals (i.e. increase production, which has the side effect of raising air pollution) and also cooperate with others agents by altering their emission rate according to the air quality. The agents play an adapted version of the evolutionary N-Person Prisoners' Dilemma game in a non-deterministic environment; they have two decisions: decrease or increase the emission. The rewards/penalties are influenced by the pollutant concentration which is, in turn, determined using climatic parameters. In order to give predictions about the concentration of pollutants: Particulates Matter (PM10), Sulphur Oxide and Dioxide (SOx), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) and Ozone: (O-3), a two stage prediction method is used, a GPD (Gaussian Plume Dispersion) model and an ANN (Artificial Neural Network) prediction model. The prediction is calculated using the dispersal information and real data about climatic parameters (wind speed, humidity, temperature and rainfall). Every agent cooperates with its neighbours that emit the same pollutant, and it learns how to adapt its strategy to gain more reward. When the pollution level exceeds the maximum allowed level, agents are penalised according to their participation. The system has been tested using real data from the region of Annaba (North-East Algeria). It helped to investigate how the regulations enhance the cooperation and may help controlling the air quality. The designed system helps the environmental agencies to assess their air pollution controlling policies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0350-5596			WOS:000438336300005		J	Fu, Jingcheng; Li, Jianwen; Niu, Yawei; Wang, Guanghui; Wu, Jianliang					Li, Jianwen/0000-0002-6182-4025			Multipolarization versus unification in community networks								FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				83				454	460		10.1016/j.future.2017.05.023					JUN 2018	2018	Community structure and core-periphery structure are two natural properties of complex networks. Both structures have been studied separately for decades. However, few researchers focus on the combination of these two important structures in complex networks. In this paper, we explore the core-periphery structures of communities in complex networks especially community networks, more precisely, we propose a linear algorithm to divide each community into a densely interconnected core and a periphery where the nodes are rarely linked to each other. Based on core-periphery structures, we perform quantitative analysis of the edges between different communities and find two relationships of two communities in real networks: unitive and multipolar. Communities are called unitive if edges between different cores are more than edges between different peripheries. Otherwise, communities are called multipolar. Furthermore, we propose a random model called Generalized Girvan-Newman(GGN) model, which can generate community networks where communities are either unitive or multipolar. The model sheds some new light on community formation and core-periphery structures in complex systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The evolution of spatial public goods game has provided an important theoretical framework to understand the emergence of cooperation in this field. Along this line, reputation-based mechanisms have been verified to promote in public goods games by taking into consideration the historical behaviors of players. In most existing studies, individuals are assumed to participate in the favorable games (with good reputation partners) to get more payoffs, and they try to avoid interacting with individuals with bad reputation. However, the effect of individuals' reputation tolerance on the evolution of cooperation in a complex network is still ambiguous. In this paper, we focus on the evolution of cooperation in public goods games on complex networks where individuals may have various reputation tolerances. Specifically, an individual decides whether or not to participate in a public goods game by considering the reputation of its neighbors. The results show that the reputation tolerance based scheme does help to prevent defectors' free-riding behavior, and enhances the formation of cooperative clusters. Moreover, Fermi function performs worse than Best Imitation and Roulette in regular networks and random networks, but better in scale-free networks. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Models motivated by disease epidemics, such as the Susceptible-Infected-Removed and Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS), ones have been used for this task, together with threshold models. A key limitation of these models is that the intrinsic time value of information is not accounted for, an important feature for social media applications, since "old" piece of news does not attract adequate attention. We obtain results pertaining to the diffusion size across the diffusion's evolution over time, as well as for early time points that enable us to calculate the phase transition epoch and the epidemic threshold, using mean field approximations. Further, we explicitly calculate the total probability of getting informed for each node depending on its actual path to the single seed node and then propose a novel approach by constructing a Maximum Weight Tree (MWT) to approximate the final fraction of diffusion, with the weight of each node approximating the total probability of getting informed. The MWT approximation is a novel approach that is exact for tree-like network and is specifically designed for sparse networks. It is also fast to compute and provides another general tool for the analyst to obtain accurate approximations of the "epidemic's" size. Extensive comparisons with results based on Monte Carlo simulation of the information diffusion process show that the derived mean field approximations, as well as that employing the MWT one, provide very accurate estimates of the quantities of interest.

Previous studies usually considered the coupled awareness-epidemic dynamics to be two competing processes that interact in the information and epidemic layers. However, these studies mostly assumed that all aware individuals have the same reduced infectivity and that different neighbors have the same influence on one's perception, ignoring the heterogeneity of individuals. In this paper, we propose a coupled awareness-epidemic spreading model in multiplex networks incorporating three types of heterogeneity: (1) the heterogeneity of individual responses to disease outbreaks, (2) the influence heterogeneity in the epidemic layer, and (3) the influence heterogeneity in the information layer. The theoretical analysis shows that the influence heterogeneity in the information layer has two-stage effects on the epidemic threshold. Moreover, we find that the epidemic threshold in the higher stage depends on the heterogeneity of individual responses and the influence heterogeneity in the epidemic layer, while the epidemic threshold in the lower stage is independent of awareness spreading and individual behaviors. The results give us a better understanding of how individual heterogeneity affects epidemic spreading and provide some practical implications for the control of epidemics.

It aims to identify the minimum number of nodes, such that after their removal the network is broken into many disconnected pieces with a sub-extensive size. However, the identification of the minimum removed nodes belongs to the class of nondeterministic polynomial problems. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to identify the removed nodes, the smallest dismantling set remains unknown. Therefore, the determination of a good lower bound of dismantling sets is of great significance to evaluating the performances of heuristic algorithms. The minimum number of deleted nodes to dismantle a network is strictly no smaller than that to dismantle its any subnetwork in nature. Any lower bound of a subnetwork is indeed a lower bound of the original network. Utilizing the heterogeneous degree distribution and 2-core properties, we find that with previous removal of some appropriate nodes, the lower bound obtained on the basis of the subnetwork is counterintuitively significantly better than the one obtained directly on the original network, especially for the real-world networks.

A spatial network is constructed, representing each of these three dynamical regimes of combustor operation, based on the correlation between time series of local velocity obtained from particle image velocimetry. Network centrality measures enable us to identify critical regions of the flow field during combustion noise, intermittency, and thermoacoustic instability. We find that during combustion noise, the bluff body wake turns out to be the critical region that determines the dynamics of the combustor. As the turbulent combustor transitions to thermoacoustic instability, during intermittency, the wake of the bluff body loses its significance in determining the flow dynamics and the region on top of the bluff body emerges as the most critical region in determining the flow dynamics during thermoacoustic instability. The knowledge about this critical region of the reactive flow field can help us devise optimal control strategies to evade thermoacoustic instability.

Still, how local disturbances spread across networks is not yet quantitatively understood. Here, we analyze generic spreading dynamics in deterministic network dynamical systems close to a given operating point. Standard dynamical systems' theory does not explicitly provide measures for arrival times and amplitudes of a transient spreading signal because it focuses on invariant sets, invariant measures, and other quantities less relevant for transient behavior. We here change the perspective and introduce formal expectation values for deterministic dynamics to work out a theory explicitly quantifying when and how strongly a perturbation initiated at one unit of a network impacts any other. The theory provides explicit timing and amplitude information as a function of the relative position of initially perturbed and responding unit as well as depending on the entire network topology.

Given a qualitative constraint network N, our algorithm utilizes a particular directional local consistency, which we denote by (sic)-consistency, in order to efficiently decide the satisfiability of N. Our discussion is restricted to distributive subclasses of relations, i.e., sets of relations closed under converse, intersection, and weak composition and for which weak composition distributes over non-empty intersections for all of their relations. We demonstrate that enforcing (sic)-consistency in a given qualitative constraint network defined over a distributive subclass of relations allows us to decide its satisfiability, and obtain similar useful results for the problems of minimal labelling and redundancy. Further, we present a generic method that allows extracting a scenario from a satisfiable network, i.e., an atomic satisfiable subnetwork of that network, in a very simple and effective manner. The experimentation that we have conducted with random and real-world qualitative constraint networks defined over a distributive subclass of relations of the Region Connection Calculus and the Interval Algebra, shows that our approach exhibits unparalleled performance against state-of-the-art approaches for checking the satisfiability of such constraint networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-2130	1793-6349		WOS:000436422400002		J	Xue, Yumei; Zhou, Dongxue								ASYMPTOTIC FORMULA ON AVERAGE PATH LENGTH OF A SPECIAL NETWORK BASED ON SIERPINSKI CARPET								FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY				26	3					1850039	10.1142/S0218348X18500391					JUN 2018	2018	In this paper, we construct a special network based on the construction of the Sierpinski carpet.

In this paper, we demonstrate how lack of strong location authentication allows creation of software-based Sybil devices that expose crowdsourced map systems to a variety of security and privacy attacks. Our experiments show that a single Sybil device with limited resources can cause havoc on Waze, reporting false congestion and accidents and automatically rerouting user traffic. More importantly, we describe techniques to generate Sybil devices at scale, creating armies of virtual vehicles capable of remotely tracking precise movements for large user populations while avoiding detection. To defend against Sybil devices, we propose a new approach based on co-location edges, authenticated records that attest to the one-time physical co-location of a pair of devices. Over time, co-location edges combine to form large proximity graphs that attest to physical interactions between devices, allowing scalable detection of virtual vehicles. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach using large-scale simulations, and how they can be used to dramatically reduce the impact of the attacks. We have informed Waze/Google team of our research findings. Currently, we are in active collaboration with Waze team to improve the security and privacy of their system.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000435358400007		J	Ye, Qianqian; He, Long; Wang, Qin; Xi, Lifeng								ASYMPTOTIC FORMULA OF ECCENTRIC DISTANCE SUM FOR VICSEK NETWORK								FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY				26	3					1850027	10.1142/S0218348X18500275					JUN 2018	2018	In this work, we study the eccentric distance sum of Vicsek networks.

It is interesting to quantize the impact of the influential individuals on the evolution of cooperation. Here, we proposed a model where two types of players are introduced in snowdrift game (SG): normal individuals and influential individuals. The former are payoff-driven in case of lacking social influence. Whereas under the condition of social influence, the former will copy the latter's strategies strictly. Yet, the latter act as coordinators, who may compromise to be in accordance with the majority in order to orchestrate collective actions. The results show that an effective mechanism may be evoked by an appropriate population density of influential individuals. By investigating dynamic patterns of optimum value, we discover that cooperators invade defector clusters from the boundaries, and dominate defectors eventually. Moreover, we also studied the cooperation frequency of both types of individuals evolving over time. It is observed that normal individuals have higher cooperation frequency initially. Later, influential individuals have higher cooperation level than normal ones, and keep it after the system stabilizes. In the process of solving coordination problems, influential individuals contribute to maintenance of rules and orders, which induce cooperation. These results may provide an insight into understanding the evolution of the individual behaviors and social orders in respect of social influence.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1742-5468			WOS:000436022400001		J	Yang, Han-Xin; Wu, Zhi-Xi				Wu, Zhi-Xi/B-2207-2009; Yang, Han-Xin/G-4757-2011	Wu, Zhi-Xi/0000-0002-2982-2177; Yang, Han-Xin/0000-0002-9642-9228			Enhancement of cooperation by giving high-degree neighbors more help								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										063407	10.1088/1742-5468/aac2fc					JUN 2018	2018	In this paper, we study the effect of preferential assistance on cooperation in the donation game. Cooperators provide benefits to their neighbors at some costs. Defectors pay no cost and do not distribute any benefits. The total contribution of a cooperator is fixed and he/she distributes his/her contribution unevenly to his/her neighbors. Each individual is assigned a weight that is the power of its degree, where the exponent a is an adjustable parameter. The amount that cooperator i contributes to a neighbor j is proportional to j's weight. Interestingly, we find that there exists an optimal value of alpha (which is positive), leading to the highest cooperation level. This phenomenon indicates that, to enhance cooperation, individuals could give high-degree neighbors more help, but only to a certain extent.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1742-5468			WOS:000436113800001		J	Aral, Atakan; Ovatman, Tolga				Aral, Atakan/D-8734-2014; Ovatman, Tolga/N-9296-2013	Aral, Atakan/0000-0002-2281-8183; Ovatman, Tolga/0000-0001-5918-3145			A Decentralized Replica Placement Algorithm for Edge Computing								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORK AND SERVICE MANAGEMENT				15	2			516	529		10.1109/TNSM.2017.2788945					JUN 2018	2018	As the devices that make up the Internet become more powerful, algorithms that orchestrate cloud systems are on the verge of putting more responsibility for computation and storage on these devices. In our current age of Big Data, dissemination and storage of data across end cloud devices is becoming a prominent problem subject to this expansion. In this paper, we propose a distributed data dissemination approach that relies on dynamic creation/replacement/removal of replicas guided by continuous monitoring of data requests coming from edge nodes of the underlying network. Our algorithm exploits geographical locality of data during the dissemination process due to the plenitude of common data requests that stem from the clients within a close proximity. Our results using both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that a decentralized replica placement approach provides significant cost benefits compared to client side caching that is widely used in traditional distributed systems.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1932-4537			WOS:000435177300002		J	Kuhnle, Alan; Alim, Md Abdul; Li, Xiang; Zhang, Huiling; Thai, My T.								Multiplex Influence Maximization in Online Social Networks With Heterogeneous Diffusion Models								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SYSTEMS				5	2			418	429		10.1109/TCSS.2018.2813262					JUN 2018	2018	Motivated by online social networks that are linked together through overlapping users, we study the influence maximization problem on a multiplex, with each layer endowed with its own model of influence diffusion. This problem is a novel version of the influence maximization problem that necessitates new analysis incorporating the type of propagation on each layer of the multiplex. We identify a new property, generalized deterministic submodular, which when satisfied by the propagation in each layer, ensures that the propagation on the multiplex overall is submodular-for this case, we formulate influential seed finder (ISF), the greedy algorithm with approximation ratio (1 - 1/e). Since the size of a multiplex comprising multiple OSNs may encompass billions of users, we formulate an algorithm knapsack seeding of network (KSN) that runs on each layer of the multiplex in parallel. KSN takes an a-approximation algorithm A for the influence maximization problem on a single network as input, and has approximation ratio ((1 - epsilon)alpha)/((o + l)k) for arbitrary epsilon > 0, o is the number of overlapping users, and k is the number of layers in the multiplex. Experiments on real and synthesized multiplexes validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms for the problem of influence maximization in the heterogeneous multiplex. Implementations of ISF and KSN are available at http://www.alankuhnle.com/papers/mim/mim.html.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2329-924X			WOS:000433380700011		J	Mukherjee, Rajarshi; Mukherjee, Sumit; Sen, Subhabrata								DETECTION THRESHOLDS FOR THE beta-MODEL ON SPARSE GRAPHS								ANNALS OF STATISTICS				46	3			1288	1317		10.1214/17-AOS1585					JUN 2018	2018	In this paper, we study sharp thresholds for detecting sparse signals in beta-models for potentially sparse random graphs. The results demonstrate interesting interplay between graph sparsity, signal sparsity and signal strength. In regimes of moderately dense signals, irrespective of graph sparsity, the detection thresholds mirror corresponding results in independent Gaussian sequence problems. For sparser signals, extreme graph sparsity implies that all tests are asymptotically powerless, irrespective of the signal strength. On the other hand, sharp detection thresholds are obtained, up to matching constants, on denser graphs. The phase transitions mentioned above are sharp. As a crucial ingredient, we study a version of the higher criticism test which is provably sharp up to optimal constants in the regime of sparse signals. The theoretical results are further verified by numerical simulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-5364			WOS:000435502200013		J	Kudo, Takanori; Kimura, Tomotaka; Inoue, Yoshiaki; Aman, Hirohisa; Hirata, Kouji								Stochastic modeling of self-evolving botnets with vulnerability discovery								COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS				124				101	110		10.1016/j.comcom.2018.04.010					JUN 2018	2018	Machine learning techniques have been actively studied and achieved significant performance improvements in various kinds of tasks.

We highlight the emergence of structural entrenchment: the retention of structural features, such as closed triangles and spillover edges, which are formed under historically different conditions from those currently driving network evolution.

Recent research has focused on the effect of spatial and connectivity structure in promoting the emergence of cooperation in scenarios where individuals play games with their neighbors, using simple "memoryless" rules to decide their choice of strategy in repeated games. While heterogeneity and structural features such as clustering have been seen to lead to reasonable levels of cooperation in very restricted settings, no conditions on network structure have been established, which robustly ensure the emergence of cooperation in a manner that is not overly sensitive to parameters such as network size, average degree, or the initial proportion of cooperating individuals. Here, we consider a natural random network model, with parameters that allow us to vary the level of "community" structure in the network, as well as the number of high degree hub nodes. We investigate the effect of varying these structural features and show that, for appropriate choices of these parameters, cooperative behavior does now emerge in a truly robust fashion and to a previously unprecedented degree. The implication is that cooperation (as modelled here by PD games) can become the social norm in societal structures divided into smaller communities, and in which hub nodes provide the majority of inter-community connections.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-1242	2050-1250		WOS:000433948000005		J	Badham, Jennifer; Kee, Frank; Hunter, Ruth F.

Our study investigates brokerage as a public good. We focus on the positive and negative externalities of specific kinds of brokers: "hubs,'' who act as the main interfaces between members of their own network community ("network neighbors'') and members of other communities. Because hubs access diverse knowledge and perspectives, they create positive externalities by providing novel ideas to their network neighbors. But hubs also generate negative externalities: extensive cross-community activity puts heavy demands on their attention and time, so that hubs may not provide strong commitment to their neighbors' projects. Because of this, network neighbors experience different externalities from hubs depending on their own formal role in projects. We use insights from our fieldwork in the French television game show industry to illustrate the mechanisms at play, and we test our theory with archival data on this industry from 1995 to 2012. Results suggest that the positive externalities of hubs help their neighbors contribute to the success of projects when these neighbors hold creativity-focused roles; yet the negative externalities of hubs hinder their neighbors' contributions when they hold efficiency-focused roles.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0001-8392	1930-3815		WOS:000431955700005		J	Jelisavcic, Vladisav; Stojkovic, Ivan; Milutinovic, Veljko; Obradovic, Zoran				Stojkovic, Ivan/J-6208-2019	Stojkovic, Ivan/0000-0002-5957-7395			Fast learning of scale-free networks based on Cholesky factorization								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS				33	6			1322	1339		10.1002/int.21984					JUN 2018	2018	Recovering network connectivity structure from high-dimensional observations is of increasing importance in statistical learning applications. A prominent approach is to learn a Sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field by optimizing regularized maximum likelihood, where the sparsity is induced by imposing L-1 norm on the entries of a precision matrix. In this article, we shed light on an alternative objective, where instead of precision, its Cholesky factor is penalized by the L-1 norm. We show that such an objective criterion possesses attractive properties that allowed us to develop a very fast Scale-Free Networks Estimation Through Cholesky factorization (SNETCH) optimization algorithm based on coordinate descent, which is highly parallelizable and can exploit an active set approach. The approach is particularly suited for problems with structures that allow sparse Cholesky factor, an important example being scale-free networks. Evaluation on synthetically generated examples and high-impact applications from a biomedical domain of up to more than 900,000 variables provides evidence that for such tasks the SNETCH algorithm can learn the underlying structure more accurately, and an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches based on the L-1 penalized precision matrix.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-8173	1098-111X		WOS:000430391700010		J	Zhou, Xiaoping; Liang, Xun; Du, Xiaoyong; Zhao, Jichao				Zhou, Xiaoping/L-2980-2019	Zhou, Xiaoping/0000-0001-5278-6576			Structure Based User Identification across Social Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE AND DATA ENGINEERING				30	6			1178	1191		10.1109/TKDE.2017.2784430					JUN 1 2018	2018	Identification of anonymous identical users of cross-platforms refers to the recognition of the accounts belonging to the same individual among multiple Social Network (SN) platforms. Evidently, cross-platform exploration may help solve many problems in social computing, in both theory and practice. However, it is still an intractable problem due to the fragmentation, inconsistency, and disruption of the accessible information among SNs. Different from the efforts implemented on user profiles and users' content, many studies have noticed the accessibility and reliability of network structure in most of the SNs for addressing this issue. Although substantial achievements have been made, most of the current network structure-based solutions, requiring prior knowledge of some given identified users, are supervised or semi-supervised. It is laborious to label the prior knowledge manually in some scenarios where prior knowledge is hard to obtain. Noticing that friend relationships are reliable and consistent in different SNs, we proposed an unsupervised scheme, termed Friend Relationship-based User Identification algorithm without Prior knowledge (FRUI-P). The FRUI-P first extracts the friend feature of each user in an SN into friend feature vector, and then calculates the similarities of all the candidate identical users between two SNs. Finally, a one-to-one map scheme is developed to identify the users based on the similarities. Moreover, FRUI-P is proved to be efficient theoretically. Results of extensive experiments demonstrated that FRUI-P performs much better than current state-of-art network structure-based algorithm without prior knowledge. Due to its high precision, FRUI-P can additionally be utilized to generate prior knowledge for supervised and semi-supervised schemes. In applications, the unsupervised anonymous identical user identification method accommodates more scenarios where the seed users are unobtainable.									6	1	0	0	0	7			1041-4347	1558-2191		WOS:000431441200013		J	Kim, Sang-Yoon; Lim, Woochang								Effect of spike-timing-dependent plasticity on stochastic burst synchronization in a scale-free neuronal network								COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS				12	3			315	342		10.1007/s11571-017-9470-0					JUN 2018	2018	We consider an excitatory population of subthreshold Izhikevich neurons which cannot fire spontaneously without noise. As the coupling strength passes a threshold, individual neurons exhibit noise-induced burstings. This neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). However, STDP was not considered in previous works on stochastic burst synchronization (SBS) between noise-induced burstings of sub-threshold neurons. Here, we study the effect of additive STDP on SBS by varying the noise intensity D in the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (SFN). One of our main findings is a Matthew effect in synaptic plasticity which occurs due to a positive feedback process. Good burst synchronization (with higher bursting measure) gets better via long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strengths, while bad burst synchronization (with lower bursting measure) gets worse via long-term depression (LTD). Consequently, a step-like rapid transition to SBS occurs by changing D, in contrast to a relatively smooth transition in the absence of STDP. We also investigate the effects of network architecture on SBS by varying the symmetric attachment degree and the asymmetry parameter in the SFN, and Matthew effects are also found to occur by varying l' and Delta l Furthermore, emergences of LTP and LTD of synaptic strengths are investigated in details via our own microscopic methods based on both the distributions of time delays between the burst onset times of the pre- and the post-synaptic neurons and the pair-correlations between the pre- and the post-synaptic instantaneous individual burst rates (IIBRs). Finally, a multiplicative STDP case (depending on states) with soft bounds is also investigated in comparison with the additive STDP case (independent of states) with hard bounds.

Commonly, properties of an empirical network are compared to properties of an ensemble of graphs from a configuration model in order to quantify whether empirical network properties are meaningful or whether they are instead a common consequence of the particular degree sequence. In this work we study the subtle but important decisions underlying the specification of a configuration model, and we investigate the role these choices play in graph sampling procedures and a suite of applications. We place particular emphasis on the importance of specifying the appropriate graph labeling-stub-labeled or vertex-labeled-under which to consider a null model, a choice that closely connects the study of random graphs to the study of random contingency tables. We show that the choice of graph labeling is inconsequential for studies of simple graphs, but can have a significant impact on analyses of multigraphs or graphs with self-loops. The importance of these choices is demonstrated through a series of three in-depth vignettes, analyzing three different network datasets under many different configuration models and observing substantial differences in study conclusions under different models. We argue that in each case, only one of the possible configuration models is appropriate. While our work focuses on undirected static networks, it aims to guide the study of directed networks, dynamic networks, and all other network contexts that are suitably studied through the lens of random graph null models.									8	0	0	2	0	8			0036-1445	1095-7200		WOS:000431395700002		J	Xie, Huijuan; Gong, Yubing; Wang, Baoying								Channel Noise-Enhanced Synchronization Transitions Induced by Time Delay in Adaptive Neuronal Networks with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity								FLUCTUATION AND NOISE LETTERS				17	2					1850011	10.1142/S0219477518500116					JUN 2018	2018	In this paper, we numerically study the effect of channel noise on synchronization transitions induced by time delay in adaptive scale-free Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks with spiketiming-dependent plasticity (STDP). It is found that synchronization transitions by time delay vary as channel noise intensity is changed and become most pronounced when channel noise intensity is optimal. This phenomenon depends on STDP and network average degree, and it can be either enhanced or suppressed as network average degree increases depending on channel noise intensity. These results show that there are optimal channel noise and network average degree that can enhance the synchronization transitions by time delay in the adaptive neuronal networks. These findings could be helpful for better understanding of the regulation effect of channel noise on synchronization of neuronal networks. They could find potential implications for information transmission in neural systems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0219-4775	1793-6780		WOS:000431272600002		J	Luna, Sergio; Pennock, Michael J.

Their application to emergency management offers new benefits to the domain. For instance, analysis of information as the event unfolds may increase situational awareness, news and alerts may reach larger audiences in less time and decision makers may monitor public activities as well as coordinate with stakeholders. With such benefits, it seems the adoption of social media applications to emergency management should be automatic. However, their implementation introduces risks as well. To better understand the benefits and challenges, a review and analysis of the literature regarding the application of social media to emergency management was conducted. Identified research gaps were mapped into social and technological challenges. These challenges were then analyzed to set research directions for practitioners and researchers.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2212-4209			WOS:000430284000051		J	Qian, Jiang-Hai								Crossover transition in the fluctuation of Internet								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				499				407	412		10.1016/j.physa.2018.02.020					JUN 1 2018	2018	The inconsistent fluctuation behavior of Internet predicted by preferential attachment(PA) and Gibrat's law requires empirical investigations on the actual system. By using the interval-tunable Gibrat's law statistics, we find the actual fluctuation, characterized by the conditional standard deviation of the degree growth rate, changes with the interval length and displays a crossover transition from PA type to Gibrat's law type, which has not yet been captured by any previous models. We characterize the transition dynamics quantitatively and determine the applicative range of PA and Gibrat's law. The correlation analysis indicates the crossover transition may be attributed to the accumulative correlation between the internal links. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Based on this theory, network topologies can be classified into universality classes in the space of configurations. In return, through inverse renormalization scheme, a given primitive structure can grow into a pure fractal network, then adding different types of shortcuts, it exhibits different characteristics of complex networks. However, the effect of primitive structure on networks structural property has received less attention. In this paper, we introduce a degree variance index to measure the dispersion of nodes degree in the primitive structure, and investigate the effect of the primitive structure on network structural property quantified by network efficiency. Numerical simulations and theoretical analysis show a primitive structure is a key heterogeneous structure of generated networks based on inverse renormalization scheme, whether or not adding shortcuts, and the network efficiency is positively correlated with degree variance of the primitive structure.

We construct networks whose nodes are names of families and whose edges represent parental relations between two families. From these networks we extract the connectivity distribution, clustering coefficient, shortest path and centrality. We find that the connectivity distribution follows an approximate power law. We associate the number of hubs, centrality and entropy to the degree of miscegenation in the societies in both countries. Our results show that Portuguese society has a higher miscegenation degree than Brazilian society. All networks analyzed lead to approximate inverse square power laws in the degree distribution. We conclude that the thermodynamic limit is reached for small networks (3 or 4 thousand nodes). The assortative mixing of all networks is negative, showing that the more connected vertices are connected to vertices with lower connectivity. Finally, the network of surnames presents some small world characteristics. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0378-4371	1873-2119		WOS:000428493900019		J	Biro, T.

In many disciplines such as finance, genetics, neuroscience or human travel to cite a few, the network may not directly be observable and needs to be inferred from time-series data, leading to the issue of separating direct interactions between two entities forming the network from indirect interactions coming through its remaining part. Drawing on recent contributions proposing strategies to deal with this problem such as the so-called "global silencing" approach of Barzel and Barabasi or "network deconvolution" of Feizi et al. (2013), we propose a novel methodology to infer an effective network structure from multivariate conditional information transfers. Its core principal is to test the information transfer between two nodes through a step-wise approach by conditioning the transfer for each pair on a specific set of relevant nodes as identified by our algorithm from the rest of the network. The methodology is model free and can be applied to high-dimensional networks with both inter-lag and intra-lag relationships. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for eliminating the redundancies and more generally retrieving simulated artificial networks in our Monte-Carlo experiments. We apply the method to stock market data at different frequencies (15 min, 1 h, 1 day) to retrieve the network of US largest financial institutions and then document how bank's centrality measurements relate to bank's systemic vulnerability.

Here, we propose a modified version by introducing into the model a heterogeneous convergence rate which is dependent on the opinion difference between interacting agents and a tunable parameter kappa. We study the effects of heterogeneous convergence rate on consensus by investigating the probability of complete consensus, the size of the largest opinion cluster, the number of opinion clusters, and the relaxation time. We find that the decrease of the convergence rate is favorable to decreasing the confidence threshold for the population to always reach complete consensus, and there exists optimal kappa resulting in the minimal bounded confidence threshold. Moreover, we find that there exists a window before the threshold of confidence in which complete consensus may be reached with a nonzero probability when kappa is not too large. We also find that, within a certain confidence range, decreasing the convergence rate will reduce the relaxation time, which is somewhat counterintuitive. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In some flow-based networks, the load of failed nodes can be redistributed locally to their neighboring nodes to maximally preserve the traffic oscillations or large-scale cascading failures. However, in such local flow redistribution model, a small set of key nodes attacked subsequently can result in network collapse. Then it is a critical problem to effectively find the set of key nodes in the network. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to study this problem comprehensively. We first introduce the extra capacity for every node to put up with flow fluctuations from neighbors, and two extra capacity distributions including degree based distribution and average distribution are employed. Four heuristic key nodes discovering methods including High-Degree-First (HDF), Low-Degree-First (LDF), Random and Greedy Algorithms (GA) are presented. Extensive simulations are realized in both scale-free networks and random networks. The results show that the greedy algorithm can efficiently find the set of key nodes in both scale-free and random networks. Our work studies network robustness against cascading failures from a very novel perspective, and methods and results are very useful for network robustness evaluations and protections.

There is evidence to suggest that ACH Colombia’s networks of transfers differ from those usually documented in the financial network literature: they are dense, homogeneous in the distribution of linkages, and highly reciprocal and transitive. The role of financial institutions as processors of payment orders determines this topology; yet, the distribution of the values transferred is heterogeneous, which relates to the size of financial institutions as measured by their asset value or their number of clients. Results are useful for better understanding the functioning of ACH and other retail payment systems.

To investigate the properties of weighted networks, various centrality measures have been proposed, such as strength, weighted clustering coefficients, and weighted betweenness centrality. In such measures, only direct connections or entire network connectivity from arbitrary nodes have been used to calculate the connectivity of each node. However, in weighted networks composed of autonomous elements such as humans, middle ranges from each node are also considered to be meaningful for characterizing each node's connectability. In this study, we define a new node property in weighted networks to consider connectability to nodes within a range of two degrees of separation, then apply this new centrality to face-to-face human communication networks in corporate organizations. Our results show that the proposed centrality distinguishes inherent communities corresponding to the job types in each organization with a high degree of accuracy. This indicates the possibility that connectability to nodes within two degrees of separation reveals potential trends of weighted networks that are not apparent from conventional measures.									1	0	0	1	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000433547600025	29855527	J	Kundu, Srilena; Majhi, Soumen; Ghosh, Dibakar								Resumption of dynamism in damaged networks of coupled oscillators								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				97	5					052313	10.1103/PhysRevE.97.052313					MAY 31 2018	2018	Deterioration in dynamical activities may come up naturally or due to environmental influences in a massive portion of biological and physical systems. Such dynamical degradationmay have outright effect on the substantive network performance. This requires us to provide some proper prescriptions to overcome undesired circumstances. In this paper, we present a scheme based on external feedback that can efficiently revive dynamism in damaged networks of active and inactive oscillators and thus enhance the network survivability. Both numerical and analytical investigations are performed in order to verify our claim. We also provide a comparative study on the effectiveness of this mechanism for feedbacks to the inactive group or to the active group only. Most importantly, resurrection of dynamical activity is realized even in time-delayed damaged networks, which are considered to be less persistent against deterioration in the form of inactivity in the oscillators. Furthermore, prominence in our approach is substantiated by providing evidence of enhanced network persistence in complex network topologies taking small-world and scale-free architectures, which makes the proposed remedy quite general. Besides the study in the network of Stuart-Landau oscillators, affirmative influence of external feedback has been justified in the network of chaotic Rossler systems as well.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000433913900009	29906966	J	Long, Yin; Zhang, Xiao-Jun; Wang, Kui								Convergence and approximate calculation of average degree under different network sizes for decreasing random birth-and-death networks								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				32	15					1850159	10.1142/S0217984918501592					MAY 30 2018	2018	In this paper, convergence and approximate calculation of average degree under different network sizes for decreasing random birth-and-death networks (RBDNs) are studied.

Meanwhile, we discover that the ratios of the back items to front items of convergent reminder are independent of network link number for large network size, and we theoretically prove that the limit of the ratio is a constant. Moreover, since it is difficult to calculate the analytical solution of the average degree for large network sizes, we adopt numerical method to obtain approximate expression of the average degree to approximate its analytical solution.

These layers include, but are not limited to, bus network, metro network, and road network. Formally, a multiplex network is a multilayer graph in which the same set of nodes are connected by different types of relationships. Intra-layer relationships denote the road segments connecting stations of the same transportation mode, whereas inter-layer relationships represent connections between different transportation modes within the same station. Given a multi-modal transportation system of a city, we are interested in assessing its quality or efficiency by estimating the coverage i.e., a portion of the city that can be covered by a random walker who navigates through it within a given time budget, or steps. We are also interested in the robustness of the whole transportation system which denotes the degree to which the system is able to withstand a random or targeted failure affecting one or more parts of it. Previous approaches proposed a mathematical framework to numerically compute the coverage in multiplex networks. However solutions are usually based on eigenvalue decomposition, known to be time consuming and hard to obtain in the case of large systems. In this work, we propose MUME, an efficient algorithm for Multi-modal Urban Mobility Estimation, that takes advantage of the special structure of the supra-Laplacian matrix of the transportation multiplex, to compute the coverage of the system. We conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MUME on both synthetic and real transportation networks of various cities such as Paris, London, New York and Chicago. A future goal is to use this experience to make projections for a fast growing city like Doha.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-1127			WOS:000433538400001		J	Muscoloni, Alessandro; Cannistraci, Carlo Vittorio					Muscoloni, Alessandro/0000-0002-9238-3357			A nonuniform popularity-similarity optimization (nPSO) model to efficiently generate realistic complex networks with communities								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				20						052002	10.1088/1367-2630/aac06f					MAY 29 2018	2018	The investigation of the hidden metric space behind complex network topologies is a fervid topic in current network science and the hyperbolic space is one of the most studied, because it seems associated to the structural organization of many real complex systems. The popularity-similarity-optimization (PSO) model simulates how random geometric graphs grow in the hyperbolic space, generating realistic networks with clustering, small-worldness, scale-freeness and rich-clubness. However, it misses to reproduce an important feature of real complex networks, which is the community organization. The geometrical-preferential-attachment (GPA) model was recently developed in order to confer to the PSO also a soft community structure, which is obtained by forcing different angular regions of the hyperbolic disk to have a variable level of attractiveness. However, the number and size of the communities cannot be explicitly controlled in the GPA, which is a clear limitation for real applications. Here, we introduce the nonuniform PSO (nPSO) model. Differently from GPA, the nPSO generates synthetic networks in the hyperbolic space where heterogeneous angular node attractiveness is forced by sampling the angular coordinates from a tailored nonuniform probability distribution (for instance a mixture of Gaussians). The nPSO differs from GPA in other three aspects: it allows one to explicitly fix the number and size of communities; it allows one to tune their mixing property by means of the network temperature; it is efficient to generate networks with high clustering. Several tests on the detectability of the community structure in nPSO synthetic networks and wide investigations on their structural properties confirm that the nPSO is a valid and efficient model to generate realistic complex networks with communities.									10	0	0	4	0	10			1367-2630			WOS:000433513300002		J	Polizzi, Stefano; Laperrousaz, Bastien; Perez-Reche, Francisco J.; Nicolini, Franck E.; Satta, Veronique Maguer; Arneodo, Alain; Argoul, Francoise				Argoul, Francoise/F-5944-2016	Argoul, Francoise/0000-0001-9157-3565			A minimal rupture cascade model for living cell plasticity								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				20						053057	10.1088/1367-2630/aac3c7					MAY 29 2018	2018	Under physiological and pathological conditions, cells experience large forces and deformations that often exceed the linear viscoelastic regime. Here we drive CD34(+) cells isolated from healthy and leukemic bone marrows in the highly nonlinear elasto-plastic regime, by poking their perinuclear region with a sharp AFM cantilever tip. We use the wavelet transform mathematical microscope to identify singular events in the force-indentation curves induced by local rupture events in the cytoskeleton (CSK). We distinguish two types of rupture events, brittle failures likely corresponding to irreversible ruptures in a stiff and highly cross-linked CSK and ductile failures resulting from dynamic cross-linker unbindings during plastic deformation without loss of CSK integrity. We propose a stochastic multiplicative cascade model of mechanical ruptures that reproduces quantitatively the experimental distributions of the energy released during these events, and provides some mathematical and mechanistic understanding of the robustness of the log-normal statistics observed in both brittle and ductile situations. We also show that brittle failures are relatively more prominent in leukemia than in healthy cells suggesting their greater fragility.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000433513600001		J	Asatani, Kimitaka; Mori, Junichiro; Ochi, Masanao; Sakata, Ichiro								Detecting trends in academic research from a citation network using network representation learning								PLOS ONE				13	5					e0197260	10.1371/journal.pone.0197260					MAY 21 2018	2018	Several network features and information retrieval methods have been proposed to elucidate the structure of citation networks and to detect important nodes. However, it is difficult to retrieve information related to trends in an academic field and to detect cutting-edge areas from the citation network. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that detects the trend as the growth direction of a citation network using network representation learning (NRL). We presume that the linear growth of citation network in latent space obtained by NRL is the result of the iterative edge additional process of a citation network. On APS data sets and papers of some domains of the Web of Science, we confirm the existence of trends by observing that an academic field grows in a specific direction linearly in latent space. Next, we calculate each node's degree of trend-following as an indicator called the intrinsic publication year (IPY). As a result, there is a correlation between the indicator and the number of future citations. Furthermore, a word frequently used in the abstracts of cutting-edge papers (high-IPY paper) is likely to be used often in future publications. These results confirm the validity of the detected trend for predicting citation network growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000432537100018	29782521	J	Ichinose, Genki; Satotani, Yoshiki; Sayama, Hiroki				Ichinose, Genki/G-6442-2015				How mutation alters the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation on networks								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				20						053049	10.1088/1367-2630/aac2a7					MAY 21 2018	2018	Cooperation is ubiquitous at every level of living organisms. It is known that spatial (network) structure is a viable mechanism for cooperation to evolve. A recently proposed numerical metric, average gradient of selection (AGoS), a useful tool for interpreting and visualizing evolutionary dynamics on networks, allows simulation results to be visualized on a one-dimensional phase space. However, stochastic mutation of strategies was not considered in the analysis of AGoS. Here we extend AGoS so that it can analyze the evolution of cooperation where mutation may alter strategies of individuals on networks. We show that our extended AGoS correctly visualizes the final states of cooperation with mutation in the individual-based simulations. Our analyses revealed that mutation always has a negative effect on the evolution of cooperation regardless of the payoff functions, fraction of cooperators, and network structures. Moreover, we found that scale-free networks are the most vulnerable to mutation and thus the dynamics of cooperation are altered from bistability to coexistence on those networks, undergoing an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1367-2630			WOS:000432875000001		J	Ma, Jinlong; Wang, Huiling; Zhang, Zhuxi; Zhang, Yi; Duan, Congwen; Qi, Zhaohui; Liu, Yu								An efficient routing strategy for traffic dynamics on two-layer complex networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	13					1850155	10.1142/S0217979218501552					MAY 20 2018	2018	In order to alleviate traffic congestion on multilayer networks, designing an efficient routing strategy is one of the most important ways. In this paper, a novel routing strategy is proposed to reduce traffic congestion on two-layer networks. In the proposed strategy, the optimal paths in the physical layer are chosen by comprehensively considering the roles of nodes' degrees of the two layers. Both numerical and analytical results indicate that our routing strategy can reasonably redistribute the traffic load of the physical layer, and thus the traffic capacity of two-layer complex networks are significantly enhanced compared with the shortest path routing (SPR) and the global awareness routing (GAR) strategies. This study may shed some light on the optimization of networked traffic dynamics.									5	0	0	0	0	5			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000431992000005		J	Gualandi, Stefano; Toscani, Giuseppe				Toscani, Giuseppe/E-6021-2012; Toscani, Giuseppe/R-5389-2019	Toscani, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4419-804X; Toscani, Giuseppe/0000-0003-4419-804X			Pareto tails in socio-economic phenomena: a kinetic description								ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL				12						201831	10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2018-31					MAY 18 2018	2018	Various phenomena related to socio-economic aspects of our daily life exhibit equilibrium densities characterized by a power law decay. Maybe the most known example of this property is concerned with wealth distribution in a western society. In this case the polynomial decay at infinity is referred to as Pareto tails phenomenon (Pareto, Cours d'economie politique, 1964). In this paper, the authors discuss a possible source of this behavior by resorting to the powerful approach of statistical mechanics, which enlightens the analogies with the classical kinetic theory of rarefied gases. Among other examples, the distribution of populations in towns and cities is illustrated and discussed.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1864-6042			WOS:000434336500001		J	Singh, Arun J.; Chang, Chih-Ning; Ma, Hsiao-Yen; Ramsey, Stephen A.; Filtz, Theresa M.; Kioussi, Chrissa					Kioussi, Chrissa/0000-0001-8226-9908; Singh, Arun/0000-0001-7784-8008			FACS-Seq analysis of Pax3-derived cells identifies non-myogenic lineages in the embryonic forelimb								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						7670	10.1038/s41598-018-25998-1					MAY 16 2018	2018	Skeletal muscle in the forelimb develops during embryonic and fetal development and perinatally. While much is known regarding the molecules involved in forelimb myogenesis, little is known about the specific mechanisms and interactions. Migrating skeletal muscle precursor cells express Pax3 as they migrate into the forelimb from the dermomyotome. To compare gene expression profiles of the same cell population over time, we isolated lineage-traced Pax3(+) cells (Pax3(EGFP)) from forelimbs at different embryonic days. We performed whole transcriptome profiling via RNA-Seq of Pax3+ cells to construct gene networks involved in different stages of embryonic and fetal development. With this, we identified genes involved in the skeletal, muscular, vascular, nervous and immune systems. Expression of genes related to the immune, skeletal and vascular systems showed prominent increases over time, suggesting a non-skeletal myogenic context of Pax3-derived cells. Using co-expression analysis, we observed an immune-related gene subnetwork active during fetal myogenesis, further implying that Pax3-derived cells are not a strictly myogenic lineage, and are involved in patterning and threedimensional formation of the forelimb through multiple systems.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2045-2322			WOS:000432273000018	29769607
