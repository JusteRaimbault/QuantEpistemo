Here, we review and compare the evolution of domestic airport networks (DANs) for Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Russia, US and Europe during the period 2002-2013. This is the first study on a consistent global dataset and allows for direct comparisons of network features. The air passenger traffic is tremendously increasing in all eight networks, with the largest number of passengers in US, followed by Europe and China. Degree distributions can often be best fitted with a truncated power-law (e.g. Brazil and US) or log-normal (e.g. Australia and Canada). While all eight networks clearly exhibit small-world properties, the average shortest path length is between 2.1 (China/Russia) and 4.0 (Canada). Our study sets a baseline for understanding the topology and evolution of DANs.									3	0	0	0	0	3			2168-0566	2168-0582		WOS:000462187900001		J	Wang, Xianjia; Lv, Shaojie								The roles of particle swarm intelligence in the prisoner's dilemma based on continuous and mixed strategy systems on scale-free networks								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				355				213	220		10.1016/j.amc.2019.02.048					AUG 15 2019	2019	Understanding and explaining the widespread emergence of cooperation in social dilemmas remains a great challenge. Previous researches have shown that complex networks with high heterogeneity especially scale-free networks can remarkably facilitate cooperation in the case of accumulated payoff, but fail in the case of average payoff. In this paper, we investigate the role of particle swarm optimization (PSO) strategy update rules in the evolution of cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma (PD) on scale-free networks, when each player obtains the average payoff normalized with its degree. In the meantime, considering whether goods and resources are divisible, PSO strategy update rules based on continuous and mixed strategy systems are proposed respectively. The simulation results show that the PSO strategy update rules can promote cooperation in the continuous strategy system, but lead to the severe collapse of cooperation in the mixed strategy system. The nodes with low or medium degree play an important role to facilitate cooperative behaviors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Besides, the spread of disease in intra-systems or inter-systems is often not random, but with direction. Hence, in this paper, we build an epidemic model based on a directed interconnected network, which can be considered as the generalization of undirected networks and bipartite networks. By using the mean-field approach, we establish the Susceptible-InfectiousSusceptible model on this network, and then analyze the model theoretically, and obtain the basic reproduction number, which is also the generalization of the critical number corresponding to undirected or bipartite networks. We explain how coupling can increase disease infection, and this phenomenon may even lead to disease outbreaks. Furthermore, we prove the global stability of disease-free and endemic equilibria via the basic reproduction number as a forward bifurcation parameter. We also give a condition for epidemic prevalence only on a single subnetwork. Finally, we carry out numerical simulations and find that the independence between each node's in- and out-degrees significantly reduce the impact of the network's topological structure on disease spread.

First, we propose a novel discount strategy we refer to as the Influence-Based Discount (IBD) strategy, in which each buyer would enjoy a discount that is linearly proportional to his/her influence in the WOM network. For the purpose of evaluating the performance of an IBD strategy, we model the associated WOM spreading process as a higher-dimensional nonlinear differential dynamical system we refer to as the Dormant-Potential-Adopting (DPA) model. Next, we examine the dynamics of a DPA model through computer experiments. Thereby, we estimate the expected net profit of an IBD strategy and inspect how different factors influence this profit through numerical experiments. On this basis, we suggest some feasible promotional measures. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we study a susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model with vaccination in a dynamical contact network of moving individuals, where we regard mobile individuals as random walkers that are allowed to perform long-range jumps. Different from previous studies of epidemics in a random walk network with a constant interaction radius, we consider the scenario where the individuals have a heterogeneous distribution of interaction radius r and infected individuals are vaccinated with a probability depending on the interaction radius distribution. We derive the basic reproduction number R-0, which is strongly related to the interaction radius distribution and is proportional to the second order moment of interaction radius < r(2)> in the special case of a constant vaccination rate. We argue that if R-0 < 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable, whereas if R-0 > 1 then there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally asymptotically stable and uniformly persistent. In addition, we provide a sufficient condition for the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Both theoretical and simulation results reveal that the distribution of individual interaction radius has significant effects on the basic reproduction number and the final epidemic prevalence. In general, the disease will break out more readily in the population with a more heterogeneous radius distribution, while it will end in a lower epidemic prevalence. Interestingly, the results suggest that an optimal vaccination intervention for disease prevention and control is achievable regardless of the radius distribution. Furthermore, some interesting results on the structure of the underlying contact network are shown to have strong correlation with the epidemic dynamics. This study provides potential implications for developing efficient containment measures against infectious disease while considering the spatial constraints of moving individuals.

Multilayer complex network descriptors for color-texture characterization								INFORMATION SCIENCES				491				30	47		10.1016/j.ins.2019.02.060					JUL 2019	2019	A new method based on complex networks is proposed for color-texture analysis. The proposal consists of modeling the image as a multilayer complex network where each color channel is a layer, and each pixel (in each color channel) is represented as a network vertex. The network dynamic evolution is accessed using a set of modeling parameters (radii and thresholds), and new characterization techniques are introduced to capt information regarding within and between color channel spatial interaction. An automatic and adaptive approach for threshold selection is also proposed. We conduct classification experiments on 5 well-known datasets: Vistex, Usptex, Outexl3, CURet, and MBT. Results among various literature methods are compared, including deep convolutional neural networks. The proposed method presented the highest overall performance over the 5 datasets, with 97.7 of mean accuracy against 97.0 achieved by the ResNet convolutional neural network with 50 layers.

Based on the fact that the people prefer to spread knowledge to their acquaintances, a friendship-based altruistic incentive knowledge diffusion model (SIH model) is proposed in this paper. In the model, we design an altruistic incentive mechanisms whereby an individual can benefit from his friends as the knowledge level increases. We derive mean-field equations to describe the dynamics of knowledge transmission in friendship networks. The theoretical analysis identifies a criterion for the persistence of the infected and the susceptible individuals. The simulations include two aspects: the density of individuals, and the performance of knowledge diffusion. The density results show that the cost rates between the infected and hesitant individuals have a significant effect on the rate of knowledge transmission. Additionally, the diffusion performance of regular networks is greater than small-world networks and scale-free networks in our diffusion mechanism. Furthermore, experiments are performed among three classes in two courses, and the average scores and standard deviations are compared. The results verify the positive effect of our approach.

Within Group Decision Making (GDM) problems to soften disagreements, lots of consensus reaching processes (CRPs) have been proposed to converge opinions but rarely consider the existing dynamic relationships among the experts. Meanwhile, Opinion Dynamics studies the evolution of opinions based on the relationships existing among the group members by using Social Network Analysis (SNA). In real-world GDM problems the application of CRPs alone may not be enough to achieve the desired level of agreement when there is too much dissent among experts. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed that hybridizes both the process of making closer opinions realized by CRPs and the evolving relationships among experts based on SNA. This new framework addresses when it might be impossible to achieve the agreement through CRPs, which tries to achieve a potential consensus considering that if opinions are too polarized, maybe different stable opinions states are still suitable and easier to achieve by applying a SNA together with the CRP. This framework is further analyzed through simulation experiments for demonstrating its validity and some properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In this expression, | S | is the number of (weakly) connected induced subgraphs of G on at most vertices, is the maximum degree of any vertex and. is the exponent of matrix multiplication. We compare the algorithm complexity both theoretically and experimentally with most of the existing algorithms for the same task. These comparisons show that the algorithm described here is the best general purpose algorithm for the class of graphs where (.-1 -1 + 1)| S | = | Cycle |, with | Cycle | the total number of simple cycles of length atmost , including backtracks and self-loops. On Erd <spacing diaeresis> os-Renyi random graphs, we find empirically that this happens when the edge probability is larger than circa 4/ N. In addition, we show that some real-world networks also belong to this class. Finally, the algorithm permits the enumeration of simple cycles and simple paths on networks where vertices are labeled from an alphabet on n letters with an asymptotic running time of O N + M + n . + | S | .

These algorithms usually consider a single topological metric and ignore the rich topological characteristics and inherent organization information of protein complexes. However, the effective use of such information is crucial to protein complex detection. To overcome this deficiency, this study presents a heuristic clustering algorithm to identify protein complexes by fully exploiting the topological information of PPI networks. By considering the clustering coefficient and the node degree, a new nodal metric is proposed to quantify the importance of each node within a local subgraph. An iterative paradigm is used to incrementally identify seed proteins and expand each seed to a cluster. First, among the unclustered nodes, the node with the highest nodal metric is selected as a new seed. Then, the seed is expanded to a cluster by adding candidate nodes recursively from its neighbors according to both the density of the cluster and the connection between a candidate node and the cluster. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other competing algorithms in terms of F-measure and accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Reconstructing the hidden propagation paths based on the observed diffusion process is a challenging problem which has recently attracted attention from diverse research fields. To address this reconstruction problem, based on static similarity metrics commonly used in the link prediction literature, we introduce new node-node temporal similarity metrics. The new metrics take as input the time-series of multiple independent spreading processes, based on the hypothesis that two nodes are more likely to be connected if they were often infected at similar points in time. This hypothesis is implemented by introducing a time-lag function which penalizes distant infection times. We find that the choice of this time-lag function strongly affects the metrics' reconstruction accuracy, depending on the network's clustering coefficient, and we provide an extensive comparative analysis of static and temporal similarity metrics for network reconstruction. Our findings shed new light on the notion of similarity between pairs of nodes in complex networks.

This decomposition enables secondary level voltage control at regional levels and controlled islanding, which can be used to prevent the spreading of large-area blackouts. An electrical power transmission system is viewed as a fully-connected, weighted directed graph, where nodes and edge-weights of the graph represent buses and quantifications of electrical similarity between any two buses, respectively. Unlike impedance or admittance based similarity measures which are largely restrictive and do not account for topology of power networks, the electrical similarity between any two buses in this work is considered in terms of their influence over the remainder of the network. In particular, the electrical similarity between two buses is quantified in terms of the respective voltage fluctuations over all the buses in the network as a result of reactive power perturbations at these buses. Moreover, quantification of electrical influence does not have significant bearing on the computational complexity since it is computed using jacobians obtained as byproducts of solving power flow equations. The resulting directed graph is then clustered into prespecified number of zones that are weakly coupled electrically using a graph-theoretic clustering algorithm. A rule-based decentralized control strategy is proposed for effective management of bus voltages in the weakly coupled zones that are obtained as a result of the clustering process. The proposed approach is then tested on IEEE test systems for applications such as supervisory voltage control and islanding, and results in excellent identification of mutually decoupled sub-networks within a large power network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0142-0615	1879-3517		WOS:000464090400054		J	Yang, Lu-Xing; Li, Pengdeng; Zhang, Yushu; Yang, Xiaofan; Xiang, Yong; Zhou, Wanlei					Xiang, Yong/0000-0003-3545-7863; zhang, yushu/0000-0001-8183-8435; Yang, Lu-Xing/0000-0002-9229-5787			Effective Repair Strategy Against Advanced Persistent Threat: A Differential Game Approach								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY				14	7			1713	1728		10.1109/TIFS.2018.2885251					JUL 2019	2019	Advanced persistent threat (APT) is a new kind of cyberattack that poses a serious threat to modern society. When an APT campaign on an organization has been identified, the available repair resources must be reasonably allocated to the potentially insecure hosts to mitigate the potential loss of the organization. We refer to the feasible repair resource allocation strategies as repair strategies. This paper focuses on the APT repair problem, i.e., the problem of developing effective repair strategies for organizations. First, for an organization with time-varying communication relationship, we establish an evolution model of the organization's expected state, in which the impact of lateral movement of APT is accommodated. On this basis, we model the APT repair problem as a differential Nash game problem (the APT repair game) in which the attacker attempts to maximize his potential benefit, and the organization manages to minimize its potential loss. Second, we derive a system (the potential system) for calculating a potential Nash equilibrium of an APT repair game, and we examine the structure of the potential attack and repair strategies in a potential Nash equilibrium. Next, we solve some potential systems to get the corresponding potential Nash equilibria. Finally, by comparison with a large number of randomly generated attack and repair strategies, we conclude that the potential Nash equilibrium of each APT repair game is a Nash equilibrium of the game. Therefore, we recommend to organizations their respective potential repair strategies. Our findings help to better understand and effectively defend against APT.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1556-6013	1556-6021		WOS:000462364200003		J	Zhao, Dawei; Wang, Lianhai; Wang, Zhen; Xiao, Gaoxi				Xiao, Gaoxi/A-5095-2011	Xiao, Gaoxi/0000-0002-4171-6799			Virus Propagation and Patch Distribution in Multiplex Networks: Modeling, Analysis, and Optimal Allocation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY				14	7			1755	1767		10.1109/TIFS.2018.2885254					JUL 2019	2019	Efficient security patch distribution is of essential importance for updating anti-virus software to ensure effective and timely virus detection and cleanup. In this paper, we propose a mixed strategy of patch distribution to combine the advantages of the traditional centralized patch distribution strategy and decentralized patch distribution strategy. A novel network model that contains a central node and a multiplex network composed of patch dissemination network layer and virus propagation network layer is presented, and a competing spreading dynamical process on top of the network model that simulates the interplay between virus propagation and patch dissemination is developed. Such a new framework helps in effectively analyzing the impacts of patches distribution on virus propagation, and developing more realizable schemes for restraining virus propagation. Furthermore, considering the constraints of the capacity of the central node and the bandwidth of network links, an optimal allocation approach of patches is proposed, which could simultaneously optimize multiple dynamical parameters to effectively restrain the virus propagation with a given budget.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-6013	1556-6021		WOS:000462364200006		J	Busby, J.

The co-evolution of competition and parasitism in the resource-based view: A risk model of product counterfeiting								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH				276	1			300	313		10.1016/j.ejor.2018.12.039					JUL 1 2019	2019	The primary concern in the resource-based view of the firm has been competition. For many firms, however, the relevant ecology includes parasites as well as competitors - notably product counterfeiters who parasitically exploit a firm's reputational resource. This parasitic process both diminishes the reputational resource it exploits, and produces significant risk of harm as a by-product. This article extends the resource-based view, presenting an account of the mechanism by which competition and parasitism co-evolve and produce a distinctive form of resource erosion. It does so using a model which, because a firm's reputational resource exists distributedly in the minds of mutually-influencing but not centrally coordinated consumers, takes an agent-based approach. This model then naturally forms a basis for the probabilistic risk assessment of the consequences of parasitism - particularly the harm that arises from the counterfeiting of safety critical products such as pharmaceuticals. The intended contribution is to show how the resource-based view can be extended to reflect the fact that heterogeneous resource distribution is implicated in parasitism as much as competition, and to show how a model of the underlying mechanisms can support risk analysis.

Random, scale-free, and small-world network topologies are tested to investigate the impact of awareness on the spread of epidemics in a two-layer network with diverse combinations of degree and structure. Susceptible and infected (both unaware and aware) individuals are associated with their neighboring nodes in a social network structure with various degree distributions. In the two-layer SIR-UA epidemic model, a virtual network represents the connections that spread information, while a physical network represents the physical social interactions that spread diseases. We test various combinations of network structures in virtual or physical networks, to understand the impact of information diffusion on the spread of epidemics in a heterogeneous network structure. Then, the effects of awareness on the spread of a disease are discussed. Finally, phase diagrams are illustrated to reveal the final regions covered by an epidemic with various network parameters. We find that a disease spreads less if the virtual social network is more connected than the network of physical connections. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The problem is formulated within the integer programming framework and an exact and polynomial approach based on the epsilon-constraint technique is presented. In each iteration, our algorithm solves a single-objective linear integer programming subproblem. The goal of our approach is to obtain a minimal complete set of Pareto-optimal solutions. Our proposal was evaluated through several computational experiments, which included grid and random networks. The random topology was generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and the settings of the network flows defined here are those commonly used in wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks. The analysis of the computational results provide a decision maker with valuable information about which factors most affect the solutions, for example, the smallest and largest bottleneck, the size of increment in the shortest path of the last Pareto-optimal solution and the difference between the path lengths of the first and last Pareto-optimal solutions generated.

We model the unreliability of wireless links by an on/off channel model that induces an Erdos-Renyi graph, while the heterogeneous scheme induces an inhomogeneous random key graph. The overall network can thus be modeled by the intersection of both graphs. We present conditions (in the form of zero-one laws) on how to scale the parameters of the intersection model, so that with high probability: i) all of its nodes are connected to at least k other nodes, i.e., the minimum node degree of the graph is no less than k, and ii) the graph is k-connected, i.e., the graph remains connected even if any k-1 nodes leave the network. These results are shown to complement and generalize several previous results in the literature. We also present numerical results to support our findings in the finite-node regime. Finally, we demonstrate via simulations that our results are also useful when the on/off channel model is replaced with the more realistic disk communication model.

In mice, this FRC network has been found to have small-world properties. Using a model based on geographical preferential attachment, we simulated the formation of a variety of cellular networks and show that similar small-world properties robustly emerge under such natural conditions. By estimating the parameters of this model, we generated FRC network representations with realistic topological properties. We found that the topological properties change markedly when the network is expanded from a thin slice to a three-dimensional cube. Typical small-world properties were found to persist as network size was increased. The simulated networks were very similar to two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattice networks. According to the used metrics, these lattice networks also have small-world properties, indicating that lattice likeness is sufficient to become classified as a small-world network. Our results explain why FRC networks have small-world properties and provide a framework for simulating realistic FRC networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1767	1550-6606		WOS:000468338400020	30996001	J	Amala, Arumugam; Emerson, Isaac Arnold								Understanding contact patterns of protein structures from protein contact map and investigation of unique patterns in the globin-like folded domains								JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY				120	6			9877	9886		10.1002/jcb.28270					JUN 2019	2019	Proteins are biochemical compounds made up of one or more polypeptides in a specific order, typically folded into a functionally active form. Proteins are categorized into four different structural classes according to the topology of -helices and -strands. In this study, we modeled these four structural classes as an undirected network depicting amino acids as nodes and interaction between them as edges. Results infer that basic protein classes can be easily recognized as well as distinguished by utilizing protein contact maps (PCM). Toward studying the globin-like fold, the helix-loop-helix region contacts were seen to be of a unique pattern, and these remained in all the folds. Further, the averaged diagonal contacts were analyzed and identified those contacts in / proteins were higher in comparison with the other class. Interesting, we noticed that anti-parallel beta sheets were dominant in all- and + classes that lead to similar diagonal patterns. Network properties of all four basic classes were analyzed and found to possess small-world property. Findings infer that PCM may assist classify protein structure classes and it also helps in evaluating the predicted protein structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-2312	1097-4644		WOS:000467135600105	30525229	J	Fisher, Donald M.; Hooker, John N.; Oakley, David O. S.								Numerical models for slip on the subduction interface motivated by field observations								LITHOSPHERE				11	3			322	332		10.1130/L1008.1					JUN 2019	2019	Observations of ancient subduction fault zones, combined with mechanical models of the plate interface, indicate that many first-order features of shallow subduction seismicity can result from failure of areas of the interface that nucleate and strengthen during interseismic periods at rates determined by silica kinetics. In the Shimanto belt, Japan, and in the Kodiak archipelago in Alaska, shear zones of tectonic melange were accreted at a range of depths representative of the seismogenic zone. The scaly fabric and crack-seal veins in these melanges record fluctuations in crack porosity at rates controlled by silica kinetics. Temperature-dependent healing of cracks impacts the critical stiffness for slip stability through increases in contact area and contact junction strength-a macroscopic analogue to aging in slide-hold-slide experiments on gouge. The potential for portions of the interface to strengthen through mineral redistribution during the interseismic period forms the basis for a two-dimensional numerical block-slider model for slip behavior of the subduction interface, where aging follows a temperature-dependent rate law. The model responds to a population balance equation, with nucleation, strengthening, and failure of patches of the interface that have greater static frictional strength, defined in the model as "asperities" An exponential rate law for nucleation and strengthening, based on Arrhenius equation silica kinetics, leads to: (1) supercycles of buildup and release of elastic strain, (2) a temperature-based updip limit to genesis of large earthquakes, and (3) a power-law size distribution of earthquakes that varies as a function of temperature. Asperities in this case arise by stochastic nucleation and strengthening based on a temperature-dependent rate law and are unrelated to roughness of the plate interface. Over a temperature range typical of the seismogenic zone, variations in effective stress along the plate interface lead to heterogeneous frictional characteristics in the interseismic period that could control the location, recurrence time, and magnitude of earthquakes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1941-8264	1947-4253		WOS:000468202100002		J	Luo, Jar-Der; Rong, Ke; Yang, Kunhao; Guo, Rong; Zou, YaQi								Syndication through social embeddedness: A comparison of foreign, private and state-owned venture capital (VC) firms								ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT				36	2	SI		499	527		10.1007/s10490-017-9561-9					JUN 2019	2019	This paper explores the different syndication behavior in various types of Chinese venture capitals (VC), in particular it focuses on foreign, private-owned and state-owned VC firms and these firms' behavior when faced with institutional uncertainties. Mixed methods data analysis was conducted using the Simuton database of 1,173 VC firms and snowball interviews were also conducted in the Chinese state-owned and private-owned VCs as well as foreign VCs. Findings indicate foreign VC investors are more willing to build much denser relationships than those of Chinese state-owned and private VC firms in order to overcome the uncertainty. This result provides additional evidence that adopting close relationships or a guanxi-based (informal social network) strategy does not only depend on cultural issues such as East Asian culture, but also on high institutional uncertainty. Furthermore, this paper develops four propositions on how VC firms establish syndication influenced by high institutional uncertainty. Finally, the conclusion and discussion sections put forward implications to VC companies about how informal social networks facilitate the internationalization process and growth in foreign markets.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-4561	1572-9958		WOS:000468030800009		J	Guo, Xiao; Zhang, Hai; Wang, Yao; Liang, Yong								Structure learning of sparse directed acyclic graphs incorporating the scale-free property								COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS				34	2	SI		713	742		10.1007/s00180-018-0841-8					JUN 2019	2019	Directed acyclic graphs have been widely used to model the causal relationships among variables. Many existing works focus on l1 based methods to induce sparsity. However, in addition to sparsity, studies on networks show that many real networks are scale-free, that is, the degree of the network follows a power-law. To capture the scale-free property, in this paper we propose a novel penalized likelihood method by employing a log 1-norm group penalty which is the composite of the well-known log-type and lasso-type penalty functions. We then design an efficient coordinate descent algorithm to solve the resulting nonconvex problem. Moreover, we establish the estimation consistency of the estimator under the setting where the error variances are fixed at an identical constant. Numerical studies are also conducted to demonstrate the merits of our method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0943-4062	1613-9658		WOS:000467230100014		J	Huang, Wanyu; Krejci, Caroline C.; Dorneich, Michael C.; Passe, Ulrike; Shenk, Linda; Stonewall, Jacklin								Analyzing residential weatherization decisions using hybrid simulation modeling								BUILDING SIMULATION				12	3			517	534		10.1007/s12273-019-0518-4					JUN 2019	2019	Weatherizing residential buildings to make them more energy efficient offers great potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, conserving resources, and improving occupant comfort and well-being in the face of climate change. However, weatherization adoption rates remain low. Previous research suggests that social norms and energy-related interactions within a community have greater influence on households' weatherization adoption decisions than financial incentives. Therefore, an increased understanding of how social factors can be leveraged to encourage more households to weatherize is needed. This paper describes a hybrid simulation model on households' weatherization adoption decisions in an urban community. The simulation model integrates a building energy simulation model with an agent-based model that is embedded in a social network to represent the interactions, adaptations, and decision making of individual households over time. The model is demonstrated for several experimental scenarios for a residential block in the City of Des Moines, Iowa. Results indicate that social connectedness, community leaders, and delivery mechanisms for weatherization assistance all have a significant impact on household weatherization adoption. These results provide insight into the potential of policy interventions to increase weatherization adoption.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-3599	1996-8744		WOS:000467052900013		J	Li, Guanfeng; Yan, Li; Ma, Zongmin								A method for fuzzy quantified querying over fuzzy Resource Description Framework graph								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS				34	6			1086	1107		10.1002/int.22087					JUN 2019	2019	Vagueness (or imprecision) naturally arises in real-world Resource Description Framework (RDF) data. The way we query RDF data is a crucial subject because of the vagueness and the wide connectivity of such data. Fuzzy quantified queries have been studied over several types of data and allow to sum up large volumes of data in a very intuitive manner. However, there are a few works that have been led on RDF graph database. In this study, we dealt with a specific type of fuzzy quantified queries in the context of a (fuzzy) RDF graph database. We first show how these queries can be expressed and interpreted in a quantified graph pattern, which is an extension of graph patterns by supporting linguistic quantifier on edges. A query processing strategy based on subgraph matching queries is also proposed. Then, we develop an algorithm for evaluating quantified RDF graph patterns, that is, enumerating all RDF isomorphism from the given RDF graph patterns into the data graph. The algorithm is based on a backtracking strategy, which incrementally finds partial solutions by adding joinable candidate vertices or abandoning them when it determines they cannot be completed. Finally, we perform some experiments to study its performances. The results of these experiments show that the method of dealing with fuzzy quantification in a query is feasible.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0884-8173	1098-111X		WOS:000466508300002		J	Zhou, Yichen; Li, Honggang								Asset diversification and systemic risk in the financial system								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC INTERACTION AND COORDINATION				14	2			247	272		10.1007/s11403-017-0205-4					JUN 2019	2019	In this study, we have developed a complex network system from the obligation links among banks and links created by portfolio overlaps to simulate the behavior of the financial system. In the network system, we adopt a dynamic allocation mechanism of liquidity to cope with external shocks of liquidity to the bank system. This dynamic mechanism introduces a reinforcing feedback that represents the cycle of assets and liabilities, emphasizing the effect of asset diversification (interbank and external asset diversification). Our results show that the financial system is robust-yet-fragile with asset diversification: for small external liquidity shocks, both interbank and external asset diversification can contribute to reducing individual risk and stabilizing the system, whereas for large liquidity shocks, high diversification amplifies the initial impact and destabilizes the entire system. In other words, high diversification can promote liquidity allocation and risk sharing in normal times but amplify the initial shock and engender endogenous systemic crisis in times of distress. This result indicates that diversification is a trade-off between individual risk and systemic risk and is a double-sided sword to risk management of the financial system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1860-711X	1860-7128		WOS:000466348600002		J	Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta; Lovric, Marko; Mustalahti, Irmeli					Ramcilovic-Suominen, Sabaheta/0000-0002-3209-545X			Mapping policy actor networks and their interests in the FLEGT Voluntary Partnership Agreement in Lao PDR								WORLD DEVELOPMENT				118				128	148		10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.02.011					JUN 2019	2019	This paper maps the policy actors and their networks in the European Union's Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan and the Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) process in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). It analyzes power relations in the FLEGT VPA process, as well as actors' preferences in relation to a number of policy issues dealt with in the FLEGT VPA. To provide contextual understanding, the paper explores pathways of policy influence along which international actors influence domestic decision-making processes within the FLEGT VPA. We find that in the Lao FLEGT VPA policy process, power is held by the traditionally most powerful policy actors, the central governmental agencies, donor community and international development partners, while the private sector, civil society organizations and actors from subnational levels are substantially less powerful. Strong policy preferences were noted for all aspects of timber legality, except for the legality of non-timber forest products (NTFPs). Similarly, strong preferences were observed for considerations of transparency and accountability, while preferences were comparatively weaker for issues concerning i) forest communities' rights to forest and land, ii) livelihood impacts on small-scale operators and family businesses as well as those of forest communities, and iii) the involvement of civil society organizations in the VPA process. The most dominant pathways through which VPA influences domestic policy-making is the direct access to domestic policy-making, followed by the international rules pathway of influence. Based on our analysis, we argue that imbalance in distribution of power and in representation of actors in the VPA policy network may obstruct the intended outcomes and progress on important policy issues, despite the stated policy goals and resources provided by the donor community. This in turn fosters perpetual dominance of the traditionally powerful policy actors, which is likely to lead to further marginalization and disempowerment of the less powerful actors, such as forest communities and informal operators.

We find that (1) the higher self-confidence will increase the agent's importance degree to determine the consensus opinion, but will also slow down the convergence speed for all agents to be able to obtain consensus, and (2) it is conducive to accelerating the convergence speed to be able to reach a consensus where all agents can manage to balance self-confidence levels and node degrees in the social network.

This question models the community detection problem and has been extensively studied. Here, we approach it under the light of an important graph parameter. The degeneracy of a graph G is the smallest integer k such that every subgraph of G contains a vertex of degree at most k. Using a new decomposition technique, we present two output sensitive algorithms for the maximal clique enumeration problem. The first one has enumeration time depending only on the degeneracy of the graph. This is the first such result in the literature. This algorithm requires that the cliques are stored in memory. Thus, we propose a second one, which has enumeration time depending on the degeneracy and the maximum degree, and which only requires memory polynomial in the degeneracy of the graph (besides the space to store the graph itself). Then we show that this algorithm can be easily parallelized. As a by-product of our decomposition technique, we propose new algorithms for the maximum clique and p-clique problems as well as an approximation algorithm counting maximal cliques, with approximation ratio the maximum clique size.

Worldwide trade underpins food security by distributing food surpluses to food deficient countries. The study of agricultural product flows can provide insights on the complex interactions between exporting and importing countries and the resulting network structures. Commercial partnerships between countries can be modelled using a complex network approach. Based on the detailed trade matrices from FAO covering the period from 1986 to 2013, we present an analysis of the world cereal trade in terms of weighted and directed networks. The network nodes are the countries and the links are the trades of agricultural products in mass. We reveal the changing topology and degree distribution of the world network during the studied period. We distinguish three entangled subnetwork structures when considering the temporal stability of the trades. The three subnetworks display distinct properties and a differential contribution in total trade. Trades of uninterrupted activity over the 28-year study period compose the backbone network which accounts for two thirds of all traded mass and is scale-free. Inversely, two thirds of the trades only have one or two consecutive years of activity and define the transient subnetwork which displays random growth and accounts for very little traded mass. The trades of intermediate duration display an exponential growth both in numbers and in traded mass and define the intermediate subnetwork. The topology of each subnetwork is a time invariant. The identification of invariant structures is a useful basis for developing prospective agri-food network modelling to assess their resilience to perturbations and shocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000468607400017	31116751	J	Omony, Jimmy; de Jong, Anne; Kok, Jan; van Hijum, Sacha A.

Reconstruction and inference of the Lactococcus lactis MG1363 gene co-expression network								PLOS ONE				14	5					e0214868	10.1371/journal.pone.0214868					MAY 22 2019	2019	Lactic acid bacteria are Gram-positive bacteria used throughout the world in many industrial applications for their acidification, flavor and texture formation attributes. One of the species, Lactococcus lactis, is employed for the production of fermented milk products like cheese, buttermilk and quark. It ferments lactose to lactic acid and, thus, helps improve the shelf life of the products. Many physiological and transcriptome studies have been performed in L. lactis in order to comprehend and improve its biotechnological assets. Using large amounts of transcriptome data to understand and predict the behavior of biological processes in bacterial or other cell types is a complex task. Gene networks enable predicting gene behavior and function in the context of transcriptionally linked processes. We reconstruct and present the gene co-expression network (GCN) for the most widely studied L. lactis strain, MG1363, using publicly available transcriptome data. Several methods exist to generate and judge the quality of GCNs. Different reconstruction methods lead to networks with varying structural properties, consequently altering gene clusters. We compared the structural properties of the MG1363 GCNs generated by five methods, namely Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, GeneNet, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and Sparse PArtial Correlation Estimation (SPACE). Using SPACE, we generated an L. lactis MG1363 GCN and assessed its quality using modularity and structural and biological criteria. The L. lactis MG1363 GCN has structural properties similar to those of the gold-standard networks of Escherichia coli K-12 and Bacillus subtilis 168. We showcase that the network can be used to mine for genes with similar expression profiles that are also generally linked to the same biological process.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000468607400005	31116749	J	Biamonte, Jacob; Faccin, Mauro; De Domenico, Manlio								Complex networks from classical to quantum								COMMUNICATIONS PHYSICS				2						53	10.1038/s42005-019-0152-6					MAY 21 2019	2019	Recent progress in applying complex network theory to problems in quantum information has resulted in a beneficial cross-over.

Novel quantum induced effects have been predicted in random graphs-where edges represent entangled links-and quantum computer algorithms have been proposed to offer enhancement for several network problems.

We conducted multi-agent simulations to, among others, find out how the topology of the underlying social networks affects the results. We also devised a mean-field approximation to confirm the simulation results and to better understand the influences of an imperfect vaccine. The main measure of a subsidy' performance was the total social payoff as a sum of vaccination costs, infection costs, and tax burdens due to the subsidy. We find two types of situations in which vaccination-subsidizing policies act counterproductively. The first type arises when the subsidy attempts to increase vaccination among past non-vaccinators, which inadvertently creates a negative incentive for voluntary vaccinators to abstain from vaccination in hope of getting subsidized. The second type is a consequence of overspending at which point the marginal cost of further increasing vaccination coverage is higher than the corresponding marginal cost of infections avoided by this increased coverage. The topology of the underlying social networks considerably worsens the subsidy's performance if connections become random and heterogeneous, as is often the case in human social networks. An imperfect vaccine also worsens the subsidy's performance, thus narrowing or completely closing the window for vaccination-subsidizing policies to beat the no-subsidy policy. These results imply that subsidies should be aimed at voluntary vaccinators while avoiding overspending. Once this is achieved, it makes little difference whether the subsidy fully or partly offsets the vaccination cost. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We focus on the main connective features of the world trade network (WTN) and their dynamics. Results suggest that countries' efforts to attain the benefits of trade have resulted in an intertwined network that is increasingly dense, reciprocal, and clustered. However, these features do not correspond to a linear aggregation of the characteristics of its constituents (trade sectors). Trade linkages are distributed homogeneously among countries, but their intensity (i.e. their value) is highly concentrated in a small set of countries. The main connective features of the WTN were not affected by the 2007-2008 international financial crisis. However, we find that the crisis marks a turning point in the evolution of the WTN from a two-group (led by the US and Germany) to a three-group (led by the US, Germany, and China) hierarchical structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0963-8199	1469-9559		WOS:000462863600004		J	Eddine Bahbouhi, Jalal; Moussa, Najem								A graph-based model for public goods with leaderships								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				349				53	61		10.1016/j.amc.2018.12.038					MAY 15 2019	2019	So far, research into pubic goods games has been limited to studying the effects of leadership in an experimental works. The results found differ according to the population studied, the number of participants and the country chosen, which makes ideas imprecise when it comes to understanding how cooperation evolves. In this article we try to generalize these works by introducing an agent-based model to simulate interactions in public goods games on a graph, and study the impact of leadership by example on the evolution of cooperation among selfish individuals in a scale-free network. Consistent with recent experimental studies, our results show that leading by example leads to a significant increase in the overall contribution and the group's welfare, as compared to the situation without leadership. We have demonstrated also that strong leaders have an important role in promoting optimal cooperation in public goods games and consequently they bring more welfare to their groups.

By these comparisons, we find that, among all these methods, the pull control method is remarkable, as it can extend the synchronization (coupling strength) region from both the left and right sides, for any controlled node.

One of the interesting phenomena driven by such heterogeneities is the friendship paradox (FP), stating that the mean degree of one's neighbors is larger than the degree of oneself. Alternatively, one can use the median degree of neighbors as well as the fraction of neighbors having a higher degree than oneself. Each of these reflects on how people perceive their neighborhoods, i.e., their perception models, hence how they feel peer pressure. In our paper, we study the impact of perception models on the FP by comparing three versions of the perception model in networks generated with a given degree distribution and a tunable degree-degree correlation or assortativity. The increasing assortativity is expected to decrease network-level peer pressure, while we find a nontrivial behavior only for the mean-based perception model. By simulating opinion formation, in which the opinion adoption probability of an individual is given as a function of individual peer pressure, we find that it takes the longest time to reach consensus when individuals adopt the median-based perception model compared to other versions. Our findings suggest that one needs to consider the proper perception model for better modeling human behaviors and social dynamics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000467736800004		J	Bhattacharyya, Samit; Vutha, Amit; Bauch, Chris T.

Here we model a coupled behaviour-disease system where individual risk perception regarding vaccines and infection are shaped by their personal experiences and the experiences of others. Information about vaccines and infection either propagates through the network or becomes available through globally available sources. Dynamics are studied on a range of network types. Individuals choose to vaccinate according to their personal perception of risk and information about infection prevalence. We study events ranging from common and mild, to severe and rare. We find that vaccine and infection adverse events have asymmetric impacts. Vaccine (but not infection) adverse events may significantly prolong the tail of an outbreak. Similarly, introducing a small risk of a vaccine adverse event may cause a steep decline in vaccine coverage, especially on scale-free networks. Global dissemination of information about infection prevalence boosts vaccine coverage more than local dissemination. Taken together, these findings highlight the dangers associated with vaccine rumour propagation through scale-free networks such as those exhibited by online social media, as well as the benefits of disseminating public health information through mass media.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000467538500044	31073195	J	Shuvaev, Sergey A.; Baserdem, Batuhan; Zador, Anthony M.; Koulakov, Alexei A.								Network cloning using DNA barcodes								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				116	19			9610	9615		10.1073/pnas.1706012116					MAY 7 2019	2019	The connections between neurons determine the computations performed by both artificial and biological neural networks. Recently, we have proposed SYNSeq, a method for converting the connectivity of a biological network into a form that can exploit the tremendous efficiencies of high-throughput DNA sequencing. In SYNSeq, each neuron is tagged with a random sequence of DNA-a "barcode"and synapses are represented as barcode pairs. SYNSeq addresses the analysis problem, reducing a network into a suspension of barcode pairs. Here, we formulate a complementary synthesis problem: How can the suspension of barcode pairs be used to "clone" or copy the network back into an uninitialized tabula rasa network? Although this synthesis problem might be expected to be computationally intractable, we find that, surprisingly, this problem can be solved efficiently, using only neuron-local information. We present the "one-barcode-one-cell" (OBOC) algorithm, which forces all barcodes of a given sequence to coalesce into the same neuron, and show that it converges in a number of steps that is a power law of the network size. Rapid and reliable network cloning with single-synapse precision is thus theoretically possible.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000467226400065	31019094	J	Barnes, Michele L.; Bodin, Orjan; McClanahan, Tim R.; Kittinger, John N.; Hoey, Andrew S.; Gaoue, Orou G.; Graham, Nicholas A.

To help capture this complexity, we advance an interdisciplinary network modeling framework to identify important relationships between people and nature that can influence environmental conditions. Drawing on comprehensive social and ecological data from five coral reef fishing communities in Kenya; including interviews with 648 fishers, underwater visual census data of reef ecosystem condition, and time-series landings data; we show that positive ecological conditions are associated with 'social-ecological network closure' - i.e., fully linked and thus closed network structures between social actors and ecological resources. Our results suggest that when fishers facing common dilemmas form cooperative communication ties with direct resource competitors, they may achieve positive gains in reef fish biomass and functional richness. Our work provides key empirical insight to a growing body of research on social-ecological alignment, and helps to advance an integrative framework that can be applied empirically in different social-ecological contexts.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-1723			WOS:000466699600001	31053708	J	Broere, Joris; Buskens, Vincent; Stoof, Henk; Sanchez, Angel								An experimental study of network effects on coordination in asymmetric games								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						6842	10.1038/s41598-019-43260-0					MAY 2 2019	2019	Network structure has often proven to be important in understanding the decision behavior of individuals or agents in different interdependent situations. Computational studies predict that network structure has a crucial influence on behavior in iterated 2 by 2 asymmetric 'battle of the sexes' games. We test such behavioral predictions in an experiment with 240 human subjects. We found that as expected the less 'random' the network structure, the better the experimental results are predictable by the computational models. In particular, there is an effect of network clustering on the heterogeneity of convergence behavior in the network. We also found that degree centrality and having an even degree are important predictors of the decision behavior of the subjects in the experiment. We thus find empirical validation of predictions made by computational models in a computerized experiment with human subjects.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000466504100039	31048710	J	Dablander, Fabian; Hinne, Max								Node centrality measures are a poor substitute for causal inference								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						6846	10.1038/s41598-019-43033-9					MAY 2 2019	2019	Network models have become a valuable tool in making sense of a diverse range of social, biological, and information systems. These models marry graph and probability theory to visualize, understand, and interpret variables and their relations as nodes and edges in a graph. Many applications of network models rely on undirected graphs in which the absence of an edge between two nodes encodes conditional independence between the corresponding variables. To gauge the importance of nodes in such a network, various node centrality measures have become widely used, especially in psychology and neuroscience. It is intuitive to interpret nodes with high centrality measures as being important in a causal sense. Using the causal framework based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), we show that the relation between causal influence and node centrality measures is not straightforward. In particular, the correlation between causal influence and several node centrality measures is weak, except for eigenvector centrality. Our results provide a cautionary tale: if the underlying real-world system can be modeled as a DAG, but researchers interpret nodes with high centrality as causally important, then this may result in sub-optimal interventions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000466504100043	31048731	J	Strozzi, Fernanda; Garagiola, Elisabetta; Trucco, Paolo								Analysing the attractiveness, availability and accessibility of healthcare providers via social network analysis (SNA)								DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS				120				25	37		10.1016/j.dss.2019.03.0077					MAY 2019	2019	Due to the increasing pressure on resource limitations and the need for efficiency improvements, effective healthcare service planning should analyse trends in citizens' demand for healthcare services, as well as patients' choices of healthcare providers, which are determined not only by prestige, but also by physical accessibility and availability. The main objective of the present study is to explore the benefits of adopting the social network analysis (SNA) approach to investigate the determinants of a patient's choice of healthcare provider as a way to support better resource allocation decisions in healthcare systems. For the purpose of the analysis, administrative data was used to track the flow of patients within orthopaedic departments of the Lombardy region (Italy) in 2014. A network was developed with two types of nodes: those of orthopaedic departments in the regional hospitals (114 nodes), and those of municipalities (5092 nodes). Using the Louvain algorithm, the communities and sub-communities were determined on the basis of patients' choices, without any prior geographical considerations or planned catchment areas.Traditional SNA measures and other novel indicators, specifically developed for this study, were applied: in particular, attractiveness (i.e. the preference that patients assign to a certain department against the others available in the same reference area) and confinement (of demand) (i.e. the degree of the unique use of a certain department). A decision support matrix based on these indicators was defined for decision makers to use in evaluating department profiles, and optimizing the location of services and allocation of resources, while preserving accessibility to care and patients' preferences. The decision support matrix was also evaluated on the basis of real practice and decisions made by regional healthcare managers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-9236	1873-5797		WOS:000468013300004		J	Karakaya, Bads; Minati, Ludovico; Gambuzza, Lucia Valentina; Frasca, Mattia								Fading of remote synchronization in tree networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	5					052301	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.052301					MAY 1 2019	2019	Remote synchronization (RS) is characterized by the appearance of phase coherence between oscillators that do not directly interact through a structural link in a network but exclusively through other units that are not synchronized or more weakly synchronized with them. This form of phase synchronization was observed initially in starlike motifs and later in random networks. In this paper, we report on an experimental setup for the analysis of RS in networks of Stuart-Landau oscillators and in particular investigate the behavior of tree structures focusing on the path to synchronization, that is, on the analysis of how synchronization emerges as the coupling strength increases from zero. We find that RS occurs in a region wherein further increases of the coupling strength lead to a direct transition to global synchronization but may also be observed in a second region, corresponding to lower coupling values, wherein it first emerges and then disappears, hallmarking a scenario that we denote as fading of remote synchronization. We show that this result is related to the behavior of pairs of remotely synchronized nodes observed in networks with more general topologies. Experiments are corroborated by numerical simulations confirming the major findings and providing further characterization of the phenomenon. We demonstrate that the distribution of natural oscillation frequencies and the parameter uncertainty in the links both play a fundamental role in shaping the behaviors observed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000466434500003		J	Capriotti, Emidio; Ozturk, Kivilcim; Carter, Hannah								Integrating molecular networks with genetic variant interpretation for precision medicine								WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				11	3					e1443	10.1002/wsbm.1443					MAY-JUN 2019	2019	More reliable and cheaper sequencing technologies have revealed the vast mutational landscapes characteristic of many phenotypes. The analysis of such genetic variants has led to successful identification of altered proteins underlying many Mendelian disorders. Nevertheless the simple one-variant one-phenotype model valid for many monogenic diseases does not capture the complexity of polygenic traits and disorders. Although experimental and computational approaches have improved detection of functionally deleterious variants and important interactions between gene products, the development of comprehensive models relating genotype and phenotypes remains a challenge in the field of genomic medicine. In this context, a new view of the pathologic state as significant perturbation of the network of interactions between biomolecules is crucial for the identification of biochemical pathways associated with complex phenotypes. Seminal studies in systems biology combined the analysis of genetic variation with protein-protein interaction networks to demonstrate that even as biological systems evolve to be robust to genetic variation, their topologies create disease vulnerabilities. More recent analyses model the impact of genetic variants as changes to the "wiring" of the interactome to better capture heterogeneity in genotype-phenotype relationships. These studies lay the foundation for using networks to predict variant effects at scale using machine-learning or algorithmic approaches. A wealth of databases and resources for the annotation of genotype-phenotype relationships have been developed to support developments in this area. This overview describes how study of the molecular interactome has generated insights linking the organization of biological systems to disease mechanism, and how this information can enable precision medicine.

Difficulties in designing empirical studies of criminal network recovery, however, have problematized research into network responses to disruption. In this study, we evaluate criminal network resilience by examining network recovery from disruption in an array of different criminal networks and across different disruption strategies. We use an agent-based model to evaluate how criminal networks recover from disruption. Our results reveal the vulnerabilities and time to recovery of numerous criminal organizations, and through them, we identify which disruption strategies are most effective at damaging various criminal networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0011-1384	1745-9125		WOS:000468211800006		J	Smith, Keith; Bastin, Mark E.; Cox, Simon R.; Hernandez, Maria C.

However, this characterisation remains incomplete and the nonobvious features of this topology have largely confounded attempts towards comprehensive constructive modelling. This calls for new perspectives. Hierarchical complexity is an emerging paradigm of complex network topology based on the observation that complex systems are composed of hierarchies within which the roles of hierarchically equivalent nodes display highly variable connectivity patterns. Here we test the hierarchical complexity of the human structural connectomes of a group of seventy-nine healthy adults. Binary connectomes are found to be more hierarchically complex than three benchmark random network models. This provides a new key description of brain structure, revealing a rich diversity of connectivity patterns within hierarchically equivalent nodes. Dividing the connectomes into four tiers based on degree magnitudes indicates that the most complex nodes are neither those with the highest nor lowest degrees but are instead found in the middle tiers. Spatial mapping of the brain regions in each hierarchical tier reveals consistency with the current anatomical, functional and neuropsychological knowledge of the human brain. The most complex tier (Tier 3) involves regions believed to bridge high-order cognitive (Tier 1) and low-order sensorimotor processing (Tier 2). We then show that such diversity of connectivity patterns aligns with the diversity of functional roles played out across the brain, demonstrating that hierarchical complexity can characterise functional diversity strictly from the network topology.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1053-8119	1095-9572		WOS:000462145700018	30772400	J	Raimbault, Juste					Raimbault, Juste/0000-0003-0768-9480			Exploration of an interdisciplinary scientific landscape								SCIENTOMETRICS				119	2			617	641		10.1007/s11192-019-03090-3					MAY 2019	2019	Patterns of interdisciplinarity in science can be quantified through complementary dimensions. This paper studies as a case study the scientific environment of a generalist journal in Geography, Cybergeo, in order to introduce a novel methodology combining citation network analysis and semantic analysis. We collect a large corpus of around 200,000 articles with their abstracts and the corresponding citation network that provides a first citation classification. Relevant keywords are extracted for each article through text-mining, allowing us to construct a semantic classification. We study the qualitative patterns of relations between endogenous disciplines within each classification, and finally show the complementarity of classifications and of their associated interdisciplinarity measures. The tools we develop accordingly are open and reusable for similar large scale studies of scientific environments. Our contribution therefore provides, besides the methodology, a new way to construct open databases and study journals for which data are difficult to obtain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000464901100003		J	Aykol, Muratahan; Hegde, Vinay I.; Hung, Linda; Suram, Santosh; Herring, Patrick; Wolverton, Chris; Hummelshoj, Jens S.

Synthesis of a material is a complex process that depends not only on its thermodynamic stability with respect to others, but also on factors from kinetics, to advances in synthesis techniques, to the availability of precursors. This complexity makes the development of a general theory or first-principles approach to synthesizability currently impractical. Here we show how an alternative pathway to predicting synthesizability emerges from the dynamics of the materials stability network: a scale-free network constructed by combining the convex free-energy surface of inorganic materials computed by high-throughput density functional theory and their experimental discovery timelines extracted from citations. The time-evolution of the underlying network properties allows us to use machine-learning to predict the likelihood that hypothetical, computer-generated materials will be amenable to successful experimental synthesis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-1723			WOS:000466338600011	31043603	J	Cao, Weiwei; Feng, Xiangnan; Zhang, Hong								The structural and spatial properties of the high-speed railway network in China: A complex network perspective								JOURNAL OF RAIL TRANSPORT PLANNING & MANAGEMENT				9				46	56		10.1016/j.jrtpm.2018.10.001					MAY 2019	2019	High-speed railway (HSR) has been one of the most important transport modes for developing cities. The development and achievement of HSR in China has attracted attention from around the world. Previous studies on HSR primarily focused on its impacts on regional development, the environment and the socio-economy. The structural and spatial properties of the HSR network have been neglected if not all. This article takes China's high-speed railway network (CHSRN) as an example and converted it into a weighted network using a P-space approach. The structural and spatial properties of CHSRN at the node and network levels are explored. The degree, strength and betweenness centralities of cities in CHSRN are calculated and analyzed. An integrated indicator based on the centrality measures is proposed to quantify the overall role of each city in CHSRN. The small-world property of CHSRN is examined, and the scale-free, spatial heterogeneity and hierarchical properties of CHSRN are examined in terms of train flow intensity. Possible factors affecting the structure and spatial properties of CHSRN are also explored.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2210-9706	2210-9714		WOS:000467306500005		J	Puga-Gonzalez, Ivan; Sosa, Sebastian; Sueur, Cedric					Puga-Gonzalez, Ivan/0000-0003-2510-6760			Social style and resilience of macaques' networks, a theoretical investigation								PRIMATES				60	3	SI		233	246		10.1007/s10329-018-0684-5					MAY 2019	2019	Group-living animals rely on efficient transmission of information for optimal exploitation of their habitat. How efficient and resilient a network is depend on its structure, which is a consequence of the social interactions of the individuals that comprise the network. In macaques, network structure differs according to dominance style. Networks of intolerant species are more modular, more centralized, and less connected than those of tolerant ones. Given these structural differences, networks of intolerant species are potentially more vulnerable to fragmentation and decreased information transmission when central individuals disappear. Here we studied network resilience and efficiency in artificial societies of macaques. The networks were produced with an individual-based model that has been shown to reproduce the structural features of networks of tolerant and intolerant macaques. To study network resilience, we deleted either central individuals or individuals at random and studied the effects of these deletions on network cohesiveness and efficiency. The deletion of central individuals had more negative effects than random deletions from the networks of both tolerant and intolerant artificial societies. Central individuals thus appeared to aid in the maintenance of network cohesiveness and efficiency. Further, the networks of both intolerant and tolerant societies appeared to be robust to the loss of individuals, as network fragmentation was never observed. Our results suggest that despite differences in network structure, networks of tolerant and intolerant macaques may be equally resilient.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0032-8332	1610-7365		WOS:000464689500008	30242533	J	Han, Lihong; Zhang, Gaofeng; Yong, Binbin; He, Qiang; Feng, Fang; Zhou, Qingguo								Statistical study of characteristics of online reading behavior networks in university digital library								WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS				22	3	SI		1175	1187		10.1007/s11280-018-0593-y					MAY 2019	2019	Composed of a large number of interacting nodes, an online reading behavior network (ORBN) in a university digital library constitutes a large-scale online social network, which can be modeled as a complex system. Online social networks have been investigated intensively by many researchers over the past several years. However, there is little research on the online reading behaviors in university digital libraries. In this paper, we investigate the statistical characteristics of ORBNs in university digital libraries. This study reveals that the degree distribution of an online reading behavior network obeys the exponential distribution. In addition, the small-world phenomenon is observed in ORBNs. This study also compares the statistical characteristics of different types of ORBNs. The results show that the statistical characteristics of online reading behavior sub-networks remain consistent over multiple school years. However, over every four school years, differences are identified between the global ORBN and its sub-networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-145X	1573-1413		WOS:000466989400013		J	Consolini, Luca; Laurini, Mattia; Locatelli, Marco								Graph-based algorithms for the efficient solution of optimization problems involving monotone functions								COMPUTATIONAL OPTIMIZATION AND APPLICATIONS				73	1			101	128		10.1007/s10589-019-00070-4					MAY 2019	2019	In this paper, we address a class of specially structured problems that include speed planning, for mobile robots and robotic manipulators, and dynamic programming.

More importantly, an additional degree of freedom is also provided for equilibrium refinement, such that increasing memory lengths and mutation probabilities contributes to the improvement of system-level objectives.

The proposed scheme considers the following aspects in a fog-computing-based IoT architecture: 1) optimal decision on local or remote task computation; 2) optimal fog node selection; and 3) optimal path selection for offloading. Accordingly, we formulate the multi-hop task offloading problem as an integer linear program (ILP). Since the feasible set is non-convex, we propose a greedy-heuristic-based approach to efficiently solve the problem. The greedy solution takes into account delay, energy consumption, multi-hop paths, and dynamic network conditions, such as link utilization and SDN rule-capacity. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is capable of reducing the average delay and energy consumption by 12% and 21%, respectively, compared with the state of the art.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0733-8716	1558-0008		WOS:000465254700015		J	Kocheturov, Anton; Pardalos, Panos M.; Karakitsiou, Athanasia					Kocheturov, Anton/0000-0003-2549-9146			Massive datasets and machine learning for computational biomedicine: trends and challenges								ANNALS OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH				276	1-2	SI		5	34		10.1007/s10479-018-2891-2					MAY 2019	2019	This survey paper attempts to cover a broad range of topics related to computational biomedicine.

In this work, we focus on the information theoretic approaches in the network reconstruction or the direct association detection, in particular, for biological networks. We not only review the traditional approaches or measurements on the associations among the observed variables, such as correlation coefficient, mutual information and conditional mutual information (CMI), but also summarize recently developed theories and methods. The new theoretic works include: information geometry to give a unified framework in detecting causality/association, the partial independence to alleviate the singularity of CMI, and multiscale analysis of CMI to avoid the underestimation issue of CMI. The new methods include part mutual information (PMI) and partial associations (PA), which improve the old measurements in avoiding both overestimation and underestimation. All those theories and methods make important contributions as major advances in the development of network inference.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7283	1869-1862		WOS:000464866600001		J	Chorozoglou, D.; Papadimitriou, E.; Kugiumtzis, D.

The network connections are either drawn whenever earthquake succession is observed between the nodes or given by the significant correlation of the seismic activity in two areas. The networks are formed for varying magnitude thresholds and for selected time spans during 1845-2017 to establish that the data are complete for each study period. Rigorous statistical analysis is performed using also appropriate resampling methods to assess the presence of the small-world and scale-free property. The scale-free property was not identified in any network and only for one of the network construction methods the small-world property could be established, disputing the universality of these non-trivial properties because are not verified for the Greek seismicity and for the specific network constructions.

Based on a genetic algorithm (GA), combined with two fitness functions, a new method is presented that optimizes inter-structures to enhance the synchronizability of interdependent networks. For bounded and unbounded synchronous regions, when the number of inter-connections or the inter-coupling strength related to the inter-structures is changed, we apply the proposed method to optimize the two interdependent networks. The first network, namely NW-BA network, includes a small-world subnet generated by Newman-Watts algorithm and a Baraba si-Albert scale-free subnet. The second network, ST-BA network, includes a star subnet and a BA subnet. Generally, the analyses and numerical simulation results demonstrate the proposed optimization method performs well. According to the betweenness correlation defined in this paper, as the number of inter-connections increase, the optimized inter-structures experience a process that shifts a nearly positive correlation to irrelevance. However, increasing the inter-coupling strength gradually makes no difference on optimized inter-structures. Overall, the results indicate that NW-BA networks are a better choice for interdependent networks than the ST-BA networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the present paper, we propose a growth model of a network generated by a random walk and show that the evolving graph forms a fractal structure with various properties including the scale-free property, if the graph which provides a space where a random walk occurs by itself is formed by the random walk. The proposed model is regulated by two parameters p(v) and P-e, which define the probability of either a roundabout path via a new vertex or a shortcut being formed by the random walk, respectively. The power-law exponent gamma describing the vertex degree distribution is determined by the ratio P-e/P-v and is related to an internal factor F-I via the relation gamma = 1/F-I + 1, where F-I is a parameter that describes the local structure generated by the random walk. A sufficiently small p(v) provides the small-world property to the model network. The small-world property is usually considered to be incompatible with the fractal scaling property (M-c) similar to l(c)(dc), where < M-c > is the average number of vertices which can be reached from a randomly chosen vertex in at most I-c steps. However, we demonstrate that fractality can be reconciled with the small-world property by introducing a size-dependent fractal cluster dimension d(c). (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the routing strategy, an arriving rate function is proposed based on the characteristics of heterogeneous traffic demand of nodes, and two parameters, congestion parameter and cost importance parameter are proposed to evaluate the importance of different transmission costs. By tuning the parameters, an optimal routing strategy with high capacity is obtained for different applications. The numerical results on theoretical networks (Watts-Strogatz small-world network and Barabasi-Albert network) and real networks (the bus and metro network in Beijing, China) show that the generated new routing strategy can significantly improve the system capacity and operation efficiency. Moreover, the significance of the proposed parameters on evaluating the importance of different transmission costs is precisely proved based on the experimental results, which indicates the effectiveness of the proposed routing strategy.

This problem is of crucial importance in the field of social network analysis. The goal of our paper is to classify existing methods dealing with the issue. We propose a classification of various methods for tracking community evolution in dynamic social networks into four main approaches using as a criterion the functioning principle: the first one is based on independent successive static detection and matching; the second is based on dependent successive static detection; the third is based on simultaneous study of all stages of community evolution; finally, the fourth and last one concerns methods working directly on temporal networks. Our paper starts by giving basic concepts about social networks, community structure and strategies for evaluating community detection methods. Then, it describes the different approaches, and exposes the strengths as well as the weaknesses of each.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0306-4573	1873-5371		WOS:000463126500045		J	Kang, Jeon-Young; Aldstadt, Jared								Using multiple scale space-time patterns in variance-based global sensitivity analysis for spatially explicit agent-based models								COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS				75				170	183		10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2019.02.006					MAY 2019	2019	Sensitivity analysis (SA) in spatially explicit agent-based models (ABMs) has emerged to address some of the challenges associated with model specification and parameterization. For spatially explicit ABMs, the comparison of spatial or spatio-temporal patterns has been advocated to evaluate models. Nevertheless, less attention has been paid to understanding the extent to which parameter values in ABMs are responsible for mismatch between model outcomes and observations. In this paper, we propose the use of multiple scale space-time patterns in variance-based global sensitivity analysis (GSA). A vector-borne disease transmission model was used as the case study. Input factors used in GSA include one related to the environment (introduction rates), two related to interactions between agents and environment (level of herd immunity, mosquito population density), and one that defines agent state transition (mosquito extrinsic incubation period). The results show parameters related to interactions between agents and the environment have great impact on the ability of a model to reproduce observed patterns, although the magnitudes of such impacts vary by space-time scales. Additionally, the results highlight the time-dependent sensitivity to parameter values in spatially explicit ABMs. The GSA performed in this study helps in identifying the input factors that need to be carefully parameterized in the model to implement ABMs that well reproduce observed patterns at multiple space-time scales.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0198-9715	1873-7587		WOS:000463120000014		J	Zhang, Mingchuan; Xie, Ping; Zhu, Junlong; Wu, Qingtao; Zheng, Ruijuan; Zhang, Hongke								NCPP-based caching and NUR-based resource allocation for information-centric networking								JOURNAL OF AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE AND HUMANIZED COMPUTING				10	5	SI		1739	1745		10.1007/s12652-017-0590-5					MAY 2019	2019	Recently, Information-centric networking (ICN) has flourished research interest. One common and important feature of ICN is that has built-in caching capability, which means that every node can cache content along the content delivery path. To improve the transmission efficiency of content dissemination, we propose an efficient caching scheme for ICN, which is named as NCPP-based caching scheme. In our proposed caching scheme, we use the definition of node-content pass probability (NCPP), which taking both node utilization ratio and popularity of content into consideration, to decide whether the node needs to cache the content. In addition, the reasonable resource allocation can also improve the performance of ICN. Therefore, we propose a NUR-based resource allocation scheme, which uses the definition of node utilization radio (NUR). We compare the server hit ratio of random caching scheme and the proposed caching scheme by simulation. Our results show that our proposed scheme has smaller server hit ratio than random caching scheme. Furthermore, our proposed caching scheme depends on the number of requests.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1868-5137	1868-5145		WOS:000463151400007		J	van der Zander, Benito; Liskiewicz, Maciej; Textor, Johannes								Separators and adjustment sets in causal graphs: Complete criteria and an algorithmic framework								ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE				270				1	40		10.1016/j.artint.2018.12.006					MAY 2019	2019	Principled reasoning about the identifiability of causal effects from non-experimental data is an important application of graphical causal models. This paper focuses on effects that are identifiable by covariate adjustment, a commonly used estimation approach. We present an algorithmic framework for efficiently testing, constructing, and enumerating m-separators in ancestral graphs (AGs), a class of graphical causal models that can represent uncertainty about the presence of latent confounders. Furthermore, we prove a reduction from causal effect identification by covariate adjustment to m-separation in a subgraph for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs). Jointly, these results yield constructive criteria that characterize all adjustment sets as well as all minimal and minimum adjustment sets for identification of a desired causal effect with multiple exposures and outcomes in the presence of latent confounding. Our results extend several existing solutions for special cases of these problems. Our efficient algorithms allowed us to empirically quantify the identifiability gap between covariate adjustment and the do-calculus in random DAGs and MAGs, covering a wide range of scenarios. Implementations of our algorithms are provided in the R package DAGITTY. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Large book networks are created by sales (two books are connected if many readers have bought both books) and can recommend new books to buy. The networks are analysed by the gender of their first author: is book consumption assortative by gender?Book networks are indeed gender-assortative: readers globally prefer to read from one author gender (the global assortativity coefficients by gender is around 0.4). Although 33% of first authors among all books are female, female books are not proportionally sold together with male books: an average of 20% (and median of 11%) of books co-bought with male books are female books. Instead, female books make up on average more than half of the books co-bought with other female books.The gender makeup of literary genres and structural book communities show that the gender homophily originates in a gender skew not only in certain literary genres (a fact known from prior studies), but even more strongly in certain book communities, with these book communities spanning multiple literary genres.

Suppose that there are a set of random variables and a set of sigma algebras where both sets are indexed by the same set endowed with a neighborhood system. When the set of random variables satisfies CND, any two non-adjacent sets of random variables are conditionally independent given sigma algebras having indices in one of the two sets' neighborhood. Random variables with CND include those with conditional dependency graphs and a class of Markov random fields with a global Markov property. The CND property is useful for modeling cross-sectional dependence governed by a complex, large network. This paper provides two main results. The first result is a stable central limit theorem for a sum of random variables with CND. The second result is a Donsker-type result of stable convergence of empirical processes indexed by a class of functions satisfying a certain bracketing entropy condition when the random variables satisfy CND.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1350-7265	1573-9759		WOS:000460420300014		J	Almoghathawi, Yasser; Barker, Kash; Albert, Laura A.

However, these infrastructure networks are not isolated from each other but instead, most of them rely on one another to be functional. Hence, they are highly vulnerable to any disruptive event (e.g., components deteriorating, terrorist attacks, or natural disasters) which makes their restoration more challenging task for decision makers. In this paper, we study the restoration problem of a system of interdependent infrastructure networks following a disruption event considering different disruptions scenarios. We propose a resilience-driven multi-objective restoration model using mixed-integer programming that aims to maximize the resilience of the system of interdependent infrastructure networks while minimizing the total cost associated with the restoration process. The restoration model considers the availability of limited time and resources and provides a prioritized list of components, nodes or links, to be restored along with assigning and scheduling them to the available work crews. The proposed model is illustrated through a generated system of interdependent power-water networks, however it is applicable to any physically interdependent networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0951-8320	1879-0836		WOS:000459949900002		J	Gu, Weiwei; Luo, Jar-der; Liu, Jifan								Exploring small-world network with an elite-clique: Bringing embeddedness theory into the dynamic evolution of a venture capital network								SOCIAL NETWORKS				57				70	81		10.1016/j.socnet.2018.11.002					MAY 2019	2019	This paper uses a network dynamics model to explain the formation of a small-world network with an elite-clique. This network is a small-world network with an elite-clique at its center in which elites are also the centers of many small groups. These leaders also act as bridges between different small groups. Network dynamics are an important research topic due to their ability to explain the evolution of network structures. In this paper, a Chinese Venture Capital (VC) network was coded from joint investments between VC firms and then analyzed to uncover its network properties and factors that influence its evolution. We first built a random graph model to control for factors such as network scale, network growth, investment frequency and syndication tendency. Then we added a partner-selection mechanism and used two theories to analyze the formation of network structure: relational embeddedness and structural embeddedness. After that, we ran simulations and compared the three models with the actual Chinese VC network. To do this we computed the elite-clique's EI index, degree distribution, clustering coefficient distribution and motifs. Results show that adding embeddedness theories significantly improved the network dynamic model's predictive power, and help us uncover the mechanisms that affect the formation of a small-world industrial network with an elite-clique at its center.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0378-8733	1879-2111		WOS:000458224300007		J	Aliabadi, Danial Esmaeili; Avsar, Bihter; Yousefnezhad, Reza; Aliabadi, Edris Esmaeili								Investigating global language networks using Google search queries								EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				121				66	77		10.1016/j.eswa.2018.12.016					MAY 1 2019	2019	Over the centuries, languages have evolved and influenced each other. These changes might have been caused by long wars, economic superiority, religious imposition or scientific domination. These macro-level forces at micro-level deeply involve individuals who want to translate their messages into another language. Therefore, the frequency of translation requests from a language to another might be an acceptable measure to show the necessity of those languages to each other given speakers of those languages are unable to communicate due to linguistic barriers. In this paper, we first collect the average number of translation requests per month from the Google search engine for one hundred languages and then visualize them by using customized presentation software to identify features and patterns. Based on the extracted information, the rank and the position of each language in the global language network have been investigated with respect to four criteria: translation balance, centrality, the number of connections and native speaker population, and interconnections between language families. Our study sheds light on the individual's consumption behavior of machine translation in different cultures. Our findings might be interesting especially for policymakers who design school curricula.

Risk education and precaution are similar to mass random immunization of epidemic spreading. In this study, the effect of random immunization strategy is evaluated based on the potential-investor-divestor (PID) spreading model in both homo- and inhomogeneous social networks. Fund flux function and system balance function are formulated. The zero point of system balance is used as the collapse point. The peak value of balance, the total number of investors involved and the total amount of principal involved are defined to compare the immunization effects in various scenarios. Mathematical derivation and numerical simulation show that the random immunization takes effect by postponing the peak position of the system balance as well as suppressing the peak values of the system balance. This kind of positive effect helps reduce the scheme's scale of total number of investors involved and total amount of principal involved. The random immunization is more powerful towards the schemes with small spreading rate than those with medium and high spreading rates. Hence, it is suitable for the concentrated regulation on a large amount of small scale and slow spreading schemes in bulk.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000467522700012		J	Zhang, Zhaoyang; Chen, Yang; Mi, Yuanyuan; Hu, Gang								Reconstruction of dynamic networks with time-delayed interactions in the presence of fast-varying noises								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	4					042311	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.042311					APR 30 2019	2019	Most complex social, biological and technological systems can be described by dynamic networks. Reconstructing network structures from measurable data is a fundamental problem in almost all interdisciplinary fields. Network nodes interact with each other and those interactions often have diversely distributed time delays. Accurate reconstruction of any targeted interaction to a node requires measured data of all its neighboring nodes together with information on the time delays of interactions from these neighbors. When networks are large, these data are often not available and time-delay factors are deeply hidden. Here we show that fast-varying noise can be of great help in solving these challenging problems. By computing suitable correlations, we can infer the intensity and time delay of any targeted interaction with the data of two related nodes (driving and driven nodes) only while all other nodes in the network are hidden. This method is analytically derived and fully justified by extensive numerical simulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000466433800006	31108723	J	Liu, Weiyi; Liu, Zhining; Yu, Fucai; Chen, Pin-yu; Suzumura, Toyotaro; Hu, Guangmin								A scalable attribute-aware network embedding system								NEUROCOMPUTING				339				279	291		10.1016/j.neucom.2019.01.106					APR 28 2019	2019	Network embedding, which aims to generate dense, low-dimensional and representative embedding representations for all nodes in the network, is a crucial step for various AI-based tasks related to network analytics, such as node classification, community detection, and link prediction. In addition to network topology, node attributes are also easily accessible and ubiquitous information that serve as an important role in network embedding. How to jointly incorporate these two kinds of information into unified embedding representations is becoming one of the research focuses on network embedding. However, most existing methods are based on matrix factorization, which is not suitable for relatively large-scale datasets due to their quadratic time and space complexity. Moreover, most real networks evolve over time with varying topological structure or node attributes. This aspect requires the network embedding method to support efficient updating of embedding representations with respect to the evolution of the network. To address these two challenges, we propose a scalable attribute-aware network embedding (SANE) method to efficiently learn the joint embedding representations from topology and attributes. By enforcing the alignment of a locally linear relationship between each node and its K-nearest neighbors in topology and attribute space, the joint embedding representations provide more informative than a single representation extracted from topology or attributes alone. In addition, we devise incremental SANE to support updates of embedding representations in a dynamic environment. Several experiments are conducted on various datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We first show how standard maximum-likelihood recipes lead to false rejections of statistical laws in the presence of correlations. We then propose a conservative method (based on shuffling and undersampling the data) to test statistical laws and find that accounting for correlations leads to smaller rejection rates and larger confidence intervals on estimated parameters.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0031-9007	1079-7114		WOS:000466441100015	31075025	J	Chen, Min; Zhang, Yi; Li, Ang; Li, Zejun; Liu, Wenhua; Chen, Zheng								Bipartite Heterogeneous Network Method Based on Co-neighbor for MiRNA-Disease Association Prediction								FRONTIERS IN GENETICS				10						385	10.3389/fgene.2019.00385					APR 26 2019	2019	In recent years, miRNA variation and dysregulation have been found to be closely related to human tumors, and identifying miRNA-disease associations is helpful for understanding the mechanisms of disease or tumor development and is greatly significant for the prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment of human diseases. This article proposes a Bipartite Heterogeneous network link prediction method based on co-neighbor to predict miRNA-disease association (BHCN). According to the structural characteristics of the bipartite network, the concept of bipartite network co-neighbors is proposed, and the co-neighbors were used to represent the probability of association between disease and miRNA. To predict the isolated diseases and the new miRNA based on the association probability expressed by co-neighbors, we utilized the similarity between disease nodes and the similarity between miRNA nodes in heterogeneous networks to represent the association probability between disease and miRNA. The model's predictive performance was evaluated by the leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) on different datasets. The AUC value of BHCN on the gold benchmark dataset was 0.7973, and the AUC obtained on the prediction dataset was 0.9349, which was better than that of the classic global algorithm. In this case study, we conducted predictive studies on breast neoplasms and colon neoplasms. Most of the top 50 predicted results were confirmed by three databases, namely, HMDD, miR2disease, and dbDEMC, with accuracy rates of 96 and 82%. In addition, BHCN can be used for predicting isolated diseases (without any known associated diseases) and new miRNAs (without any known associated miRNAs). In the isolated disease case study, the top 50 of breast neoplasm and colon neoplasm potentials associated with miRNAs predicted an accuracy of 100 and 96%, respectively, thereby demonstrating the favorable predictive power of BHCN for potentially relevant miRNAs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000466211200002	31080459	J	Jiang, Jingyang; Yu, Wuzhe; Liu, Haitao								Does Scale-Free Syntactic Network Emerge in Second Language Learning?								FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY				10						925	10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00925					APR 26 2019	2019	Language is a complex system during whose operation many properties may emerge spontaneously. Using complex network approach, existing studies have found that, in first language (L1) acquisition, syntactic complex network featuring the scale-free and the small-world properties, will emerge at the age of 24 months. For foreign language (L2) learning, however, researchers have not reached a consensus on whether syntactic network with these two properties will emerge. Therefore, this study adopts complex network approach in L2 learning study, attempting to answer this question. In this study, nine networks are constructed on the basis of English compositions by Chinese students. Properties of these networks reveal that the syntactic network featuring these two properties, instead of emerging suddenly at a certain point, has existed at the very beginning of the L2 learning of Chinese students, and persists throughout the entire process of L2 learning, which is different from what has been found in L1 acquisition. The reason is probably that the already established L1 syntactic system provides foundation for L2 syntactic learning, and L2 learners tend to use the entrenched L1 syntactic network to generate L2 syntactic structures. L2 syntactic learning thus is not characterized by a sudden emergence of syntactic system, but a gradual approximation to the target language, with its own unique properties. For the first time, this study provides a tentative answer to L2 syntactic emergence from the perspective of complex network, and provides a macroscopic description of L2 syntactic developmental trajectory.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-1078			WOS:000465721400001	31080427	J	Burkholz, Rebekka								Efficient message passing for cascade size distributions								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						6561	10.1038/s41598-019-42873-9					APR 25 2019	2019	How big is the risk that a few initial failures of networked nodes amplify to large cascades that endanger the functioning of the system? Common answers refer to the average final cascade size. Two analytic approaches allow its computation: (a) (heterogeneous) mean field approximation and (b) belief propagation. The former applies to (infinitely) large locally tree-like networks, while the latter is exact on finite trees. Yet, cascade sizes can have broad and multi-modal distributions that are not well represented by their average. Full distribution information is essential to identify likely events and to estimate the tail risk, i.e. the probability of extreme events. We therefore present an efficient message passing algorithm that calculates the cascade size distribution in finite networks. It is exact on finite trees and for a large class of cascade processes. An approximate version applies to any network structure and performs well on locally tree-like networks, as we show with several examples.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000465516600040	31024066	J	Liu, Jin; Li, Jian; Chen, Yadang; Chen, Xianyi; Zhou, Zhili; Yang, Zejun; Zhang, Cheng-Jun								Modeling complex networks with accelerating growth and aging effect								PHYSICS LETTERS A				383	13			1396	1400		10.1016/j.physleta.2019.02.004					APR 24 2019	2019	Numerous empirical studies have revealed that a large number of real networks exhibit the property of accelerating growth, i.e. network size (nodes) increases superlinearly with time. Examples include the size of social networks, the output of scientists, the population of cities, and so on. In the literature, these real systems are widely represented by complex networks for analysis, and many network models have been proposed to explain the observed properties in these systems such as power-law degree distribution. However, most of these models (e.g. the well-known BA model) are based on linear growth of these systems. In this paper, we propose a network model with accelerating growth and aging effect, resulting in an emergence of super hubs which is consistent with the empirical observation in citation networks.

Interests leave state on routers on their path, to allow Data to follow the reverse path. Despite the advantages made possible by this state, its storage requirements raise scalability concerns. We propose an adaptive semi-stateless forwarding scheme where Interests are tracked only on a fraction of the routers. Between state-tracking routers, Interests gather reverse path information, which is used to deliver Data via Bloom filter-based forwarding. We show how the fraction of state-tracking routers can be dynamically adapted to reduce state while limiting communication overheads. Our scheme allows this state, along with all other required data structures, to comfortably fit into the fast memory of a practical router. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here we apply this concept to examine the performance of U.S. counties during the Great Recession. The response of local economies to manmade and natural shocks is hypothesized to depend on the centrality of local industries within the economy, or how well connected they are to the other industries. We first calculate a centrality value for each industry using the national Input-Output accounts. We then 'step down' these values to the county level using industry employment data. We then test empirically whether local economies containing more centralized industries were more resilient, using a resilience measure that compares the local employment rebound and decline during the Great Recession. Our results suggest that measures of economic centrality adopted from the study of complex networks provide new insights when applied to the fields of regional science and spatial analysis, and economic growth more generally.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0003-6846	1466-4283		WOS:000457408000002		J	Newman, M.

The emergence of online social media has enabled access to data regarding people relationships at a large scale. Twitter, specifically, is an information oriented network, with users sharing and consuming information. In this work, we study whether users tend to be in contact with people interested in similar topics, i.e., if they are topically aligned. To do so, we propose an approach based on the use of hashtags to extract information topics from Twitter messages and model users' interests. Our results show that, on average, users are connected with other users similar to them. Furthermore, we show that topical alignment provides interesting information that can eventually allow inferring users' connectivity. Our work, besides providing a way to assess the topical similarity of users, quantifies topical alignment among individuals, contributing to a better understanding of how complex social systems are structured.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2296-424X			WOS:000465043000001		J	Fan, Huawei; Wang, Yafeng; Yang, Kai; Wang, Xingang				Wang, Xingang/G-1746-2014	Wang, Xingang/0000-0002-6851-0109			Enhancing network synchronizability by strengthening a single node								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	4					042305	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.042305					APR 16 2019	2019	In improving the stability of complex dynamical systems, an outstanding problem is how to achieve the desired performance at a low cost. For engineering and biological complex systems whose performance and functionality rely on the synchronous motion of their units, an important question related to the performance-cost-balance problem is how to improve efficiently the system synchronizability when a small amount of additional coupling resource is available. Here, employing a complex network of coupled chaotic oscillators as the model, we address this question by introducing a small amount of coupling intensity to only a single oscillator and investigate how the improvement of the network synchronizability is dependent on the location of the target oscillator. Theoretical analysis shows that, to achieve the maximum network synchronizability, the target oscillator to be strengthened should be chosen according to the eigenvector of the most unstable mode. Based on the theoretical finding, we further propose a single-node-based scheme for improving synchronization: the eigenvector-centrality-based strengthening scheme. We describe in detail how to apply this scheme under different synchronization scenarios and justify its efficiency in various network models by numerical simulations. The performance of the new scheme is compared with the conventional ones based on betweenness, closeness, and degree centralities, and it is shown that the new scheme has a clear advantage over the conventional ones. Furthermore, by a brute-force search of the target oscillator over the network, it is verified numerically that the oscillator identified by the new scheme indeed gives the best synchronization performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000464750500003	31108592	J	Cao, Jinzhou; Li, Qingquan; Tu, Wei; Wang, Feilong				TU, Wei/H-4073-2014	TU, Wei/0000-0002-0255-4037; Cao, Jinzhou/0000-0001-6201-3251			Characterizing preferred motif choices and distance impacts								PLOS ONE				14	4					e0215242	10.1371/journal.pone.0215242					APR 16 2019	2019	People's daily travels are structured and can be expressed as networks. Few studies explore how people organize their daily travels and which behavioral principles result in the choices of specific network types. In this study, we first reconstruct location networks and activity networks for numerous individuals from high-resolution mobile phone positioning data and define frequent networks as motifs. The results suggest that 99.9% of people's travels can be characterized by a limited set of location-based motifs and activity-based motifs. The results further reveal that the least effort principle governs the preferred motif choices through quantifying the rank-frequency properties. The scaling properties of distance characteristically impact motifs, and their scaling differences by node numbers and motif types coincide with the popularities of motifs, verifying the self-adaptions in motif choices; that is, although individuals travel with unique propensities, they always tend to choose the motif with the lowest consumption that satisfies their demand.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000464696100027	30990848	J	Zhang, Huixin; Zhang, Weidong; Gao, Jianxi				gao, jianxi/I-1300-2013	gao, jianxi/0000-0002-3952-208X			Synchronization of interconnected heterogeneous networks: The role of network sizes								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						6154	10.1038/s41598-019-42636-6					APR 16 2019	2019	Increasing evidence shows that real networks interact with each other, forming a network of networks (NONs). Synchronization, a ubiquitous process in natural and engineering systems, has fascinatingly gained rising attentions in the context of NONs. Despite efforts to study the synchronization of NONs, it is still a challenge to understand how do the network sizes affect the synchronization and its phase diagram of NONs coupled with nonlinear dynamics. Here, we model such NONs as star-like motifs to analytically derive the critical values of both the internal and the external coupling strengths, at which a phase transition from synchronization to incoherence occurs. Our results show that the critical values strongly depend on the network sizes. Reducing the difference between network sizes will enhance the synchronization of the whole system, which indicates the irrationality of previous studies that assume the network sizes to be the same. The optimal connection strategy also changes as the network sizes change, a discovery contradicting to the previous conclusion that connecting the high-degree nodes of each network is always the most effective strategy to achieve synchronization unchangeably. This finding emphasizes the crucial role of network sizes which has been neglected in the previous studies and could contribute to the design of a global synchronized system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000464652400025	30992507	J	Zhang, Rui; Wang, Xiaomeng; Cheng, Ming; Jia, Tao								The evolution of network controllability in growing networks								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				520				257	266		10.1016/j.physa.2019.01.042					APR 15 2019	2019	The study of network structural controllability focuses on the minimum number of driver nodes needed to control a whole network. Despite intensive studies on this topic, most of them consider static networks only. It is well-known, however, that real networks are growing, with new nodes and links added to the system. Here, we analyze controllability of evolving networks and propose a general rule for the change of driver nodes. We further apply the rule to solve the problem of network augmentation subject to the controllability constraint. The findings strengthen our understandings of network controllability and shed light on controllability of real systems.

It theoretically analyzes the effects, mechanisms, and evolution characteristics of the structure of counterparty credit network and its heterogeneity, counterparty behavior preference, fitness of counterparties, and regulatory rescue strategy on counterparty credit risk contagion in the CRT market. With the help of computer numerical simulation, the evolution of counterparty credit risk contagion in the CRT market are intuitively analyzed and depicted. The following main conclusions are obtained: (1) Counterparty credit risk contagion threshold in the CRT market is a monotone decreasing convex function on the counterparty risk preference and counterparty fitness and a monotone increasing convex function on the supervision and rescue probability (2) Counterparty credit risk contagion scale in the CRT market is a monotone decreasing concave function on the counterparty risk preference and counterparty fitness, a monotone decreasing convex function on the supervision and rescue probability, and a monotone increasing concave function on the counterparty degree. (3)The greater the heterogeneity of the network, the greater the counterparty credit risk contagion threshold and the lower the counterparty credit risk contagion scale. (4)The degree distribution of counterparty credit network in the CRT market significantly affects the credit risk contagion threshold and scale in the CRT market. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The concept of academic social networks is created precisely in the context of scholarly big data, which refers to the complicated academic network formed by academic entities and their relationships. There are a wealth of scholarly big data processing methods to analyze the rich structural types and related information about academic social networks. Nowadays, various academic data can be easily obtained, which makes it easier for us to analyze and study academic social networks. This study investigates the background, the current status, and trends of academic social networks. We first elaborate on the concept of academic social networks and related research background. Secondly, we analyze models based on nodes' types and timeliness. Thirdly, we review analytical methods, including relevant metrics, network properties, and available academic analysis tools. Furthermore, we sort out some key mining technologies for academic social networks. Finally, we systematically review representative research tasks in this domain from three levels: actor, relationship, and network. In addition, some academic social networking sites are presented.

Here, we explore the important and hitherto neglected role of information asymmetry in the genesis and evolution of such pairwise biomolecular interactions. Information asymmetry between sender and receiver genes is identified as a key feature distinguishing early biochemical reactions from abiotic chemistry, and a driver of network topology as biomolecular systems become more complex. In this context, we review how graph theoretical approaches can be applied not only for a better understanding of various proximate (mechanistic) relations, but also, ultimate (evolutionary) structures encoded in such networks from among all types of variations they induce. Among many possible variations, we emphasize particularly the essential role of gene duplication in terms of signaling game theory, whereby sender and receiver gene players accrue benefit from gene duplication, leading to a preferential attachment mode of network growth. The study of the resulting dynamics suggests many mathematical/computational problems, the majority of which are intractable yet yield to efficient approximation algorithms, when studied through an algebraic graph theoretic lens. We relegate for future work the role of other possible generalizations, additionally involving horizontal gene transfer, sexual recombination, endo-symbiosis, etc., which enrich the underlying graph theory even further.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000464462800001	31024611	J	Pagel, Mark; Beaumont, Mark; Meade, Andrew; Verkerk, Annemarie; Calude, Andreea					Beaumont, Mark/0000-0002-8773-2743			Dominant words rise to the top by positive frequency-dependent selection								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				116	15			7397	7402		10.1073/pnas.1816994116					APR 9 2019	2019	A puzzle of language is how speakers come to use the same words for particular meanings, given that there are often many competing alternatives (e.g., "sofa," "couch," "settee"), and there is seldom a necessary connection between a word and its meaning. The well-known process of random drift-roughly corresponding in this context to "say what you hear" -can cause the frequencies of alternative words to fluctuate over time, and it is even possible for one of the words to replace all others, without any form of selection being involved. However, is drift alone an adequate explanation of a shared vocabulary? Darwin thought not. Here, we apply models of neutral drift, directional selection, and positive frequency-dependent selection to explain over 417,000 word-use choices for 418 meanings in two natural populations of speakers. We find that neutral drift does not in general explain word use. Instead, some form of selection governs word choice in over 91% of the meanings we studied. In cases where one word dominates all others for a particular meaning-such as is typical of the words in the core lexicon of a language-word choice is guided by positive frequency-dependent selection-a bias that makes speakers disproportionately likely to use the words that most others use. This bias grants an increasing advantage to the common form as it becomes more popular and provides a mechanism to explain how a shared vocabulary can spontaneously self-organize and then be maintained for centuries or even millennia, despite new words continually entering the lexicon.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000463936900038	30898886	J	Brooks, Matthew D.; Cirrone, Jacopo; Pasquino, Angelo V.; Alvarez, Jose M.; Swift, Joseph; Mittal, Shipra; Juang, Che-Lun; Varala, Kranthi; Gutierrez, Rodrigo A.; Krouk, Gabriel; Shasha, Dennis; Coruzzi, Gloria M.				; Gutierrez, Rodrigo/C-2611-2008	Juang, Che-Lun/0000-0002-4788-4152; Krouk, Gabriel/0000-0003-3693-6735; Gutierrez, Rodrigo/0000-0002-5961-5005			Network Walking charts transcriptional dynamics of nitrogen signaling by integrating validated and predicted genome-wide interactions								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				10						1569	10.1038/s41467-019-09522-1					APR 5 2019	2019	Charting a temporal path in gene networks requires linking early transcription factor (TF)-triggered events to downstream effects. We scale-up a cell-based TF-perturbation assay to identify direct regulated targets of 33 nitrogen (N)-early response TFs encompassing 88% of N-responsive Arabidopsis genes. We uncover a duality where each TF is an inducer and repressor, and in vitro cis-motifs are typically specific to regulation directionality. Validated TF-targets (71,836) are used to refine precision of a time-inferred root network, connecting 145 N-responsive TFs and 311 targets. These data are used to chart network paths from direct TF1-regulated targets identified in cells to indirect targets responding only in planta via Network Walking. We uncover network paths from TGA1 and CRF4 to direct TF2 targets, which in turn regulate 76% and 87% of TF1 indirect targets in planta, respectively. These results have implications for N-use and the approach can reveal temporal networks for any biological system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2041-1723			WOS:000463472200014	30952851	J	Rappoport, Dmitrij								Reaction Networks and the Metric Structure of Chemical Space(s)								JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A				123	13			2610	2620		10.1021/acs.jpca.9b00519					APR 4 2019	2019	In this paper, we develop a formal definition of chemical space as a discrete metric space of molecules and analyze its properties. To this end, we utilize the shortest path metric on reaction networks to define a distance function between molecules of the same stoichiometry (number of atoms). The distance between molecules with different stoichiometries is formalized by making use of the partial ordering of stoichiometries with respect to inclusion. Calculations of fractal dimension on metric spaces for individual stoichiometries show that they have low intrinsic dimensionality, about an order of magnitude less than the dimension of the underlying reactive potential energy surface. Our findings suggest that efficient search strategies on chemical space can be designed that take advantage of its metric structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1089-5639			WOS:000463844300013	30848894	J	Platt, Edward L.; Romero, Daniel M.								Towards attack tolerant networks: Concurrent multipath routing and the butterfly network								PLOS ONE				14	4					e0214292	10.1371/journal.pone.0214292					APR 3 2019	2019	It is crucial for large-scale communication networks such as the internet to be resilient against attacks such as censorship and surveillance, which pose a threat to free expression and free association. Self-organized networks such as the internet's router network typically have heavy-tailed degree distributions, making them highly vulnerable to targeted attacks against central nodes. While cryptographic solutions exist, they fail to address the underlying topological problem, and remain vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and coercion. Coercion-resistant, topological approaches to attack tolerance are needed to address the current vulnerability of communications infrastructure to censorship and surveillance. We present a novel concurrent multipath routing (CMR) algorithm for the wraparound butterfly network topology, as well as a highly attack-tolerant Structured Multipath Fault Tolerance (SMFT) architecture which incorporates the butterfly CMR algorithm. We also identify a previously unexplored relationship between network topology, trust transitivity, and attack-tolerance, and provide a framework for further exploration of this relationship. Our work is the first theoretical demonstration of a point-to-point communication network architecture that can resist coercion and other non-technical attacks, without requiring infinitely transitive trust. To address cases where the network structure cannot be fully controlled, we demonstrate how a snapshot of the internet's router network can be partially rewired for greater attack-tolerance. More broadly, we hope that this work will serve as a starting point for the evelopment of additional topology-based attack-tolerant communication architectures to guard against the dangers of censorship and surveillance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000463194300033	30943216	J	Wei, Sheng; Xu, Jiangang; Ma, Haitao								Exploring public bicycle network structure based on complex network theory and shortest path analysis: the public bicycle system in Yixing, China								TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY				42	3			293	307		10.1080/03081060.2019.1576385					APR 3 2019	2019	A well-functioning public bicycle system relates not only to its mode of operation, vehicle allocation, rental station layout and vehicle leasing configuration, but also the bicycle network structure and its formation.

In this case, cascading phenomena can induce drastic and discontinuous changes in the system state and lead to collapse. Although complex network theory has been used to investigate these drastic events, we are still unable to predict them effectively. We here analyze collapse phenomena by proposing a minimal two-state dynamic on a complex network and introducing the effect of local connectivities on the evolution of network nodes. We find that a heterogeneous system of interconnected components presents a mixed response to stress and can serve as a control indicator. In particular, before the critical transition point is reached a severe loss of low-degree nodes is observed, masked by the minimal failure of higher-degree nodes. Accordingly, we suggest that a significant reduction in less connected nodes can indicate impending global failure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000463895900001	31108675	J	Ren, Xiao-Long; Gleinig, Niels; Helbing, Dirk; Antulov-Fantulin, Nino								Generalized network dismantling								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				116	14			6554	6559		10.1073/pnas.1806108116					APR 2 2019	2019	Finding an optimal subset of nodes in a network that is able to efficiently disrupt the functioning of a corrupt or criminal organization or contain an epidemic or the spread of misinformation is a highly relevant problem of network science. In this paper, we address the generalized network-dismantling problem, which aims at finding a set of nodes whose removal from the network results in the fragmentation of the network into subcritical network components at minimal overall cost. Compared with previous formulations, we allow the costs of node removals to take arbitrary nonnegative real values, which may depend on topological properties such as node centrality or on nontopological features such as the price or protection level of a node. Interestingly, we show that nonunit costs imply a significantly different dismantling strategy. To solve this optimization problem, we propose a method which is based on the spectral properties of a node-weighted Laplacian operator and combine it with a finetuning mechanism related to the weighted vertex cover problem. The proposed method is applicable to large-scale networks with millions of nodes. It outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and opens more directions for understanding the vulnerability and robustness of complex systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000463069900014	30877241	J	Tsiotas, Dimitrios					Tsiotas, Dimitrios/0000-0003-3510-8823			Detecting different topologies immanent in scale-free networks with the same degree distribution								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				116	14			6701	6706		10.1073/pnas.1816842116					APR 2 2019	2019	The scale-free (SF) property is a major concept in complex networks, and it is based on the definition that an SF network has a degree distribution that follows a power-law (PL) pattern. This paper highlights that not all networks with a PL degree distribution arise through a Barabasi-Albert (BA) preferential attachment growth process, a fact that, although evident from the literature, is often overlooked by many researchers. For this purpose, it is demonstrated, with simulations, that established measures of network topology do not suffice to distinguish between BA networks and other (random-like and latticelike) SF networks with the same degree distribution. Additionally, it is examined whether an existing self-similarity metric proposed for the definition of the SF property is also capable of distinguishing different SF topologies with the same degree distribution. To contribute to this discrimination, this paper introduces a spectral metric, which is shown to be more capable of distinguishing between different SF topologies with the same degree distribution, in comparison with the existing metrics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000463069900037	30877255	J	Jalan, Sarika; Kumar, Anil; Leyva, Inmaculada				Leyva, I./M-1820-2013	Leyva, I./0000-0001-9634-5385			Explosive synchronization in frequency displaced multiplex networks								CHAOS				29	4					041102	10.1063/1.5092226					APR 2019	2019	Motivated by the recent multiplex framework of complex networks, in this work, we investigate if explosive synchronization can be induced in the multiplex network of two layers. Using nonidentical Kuramoto oscillators, we show that a sufficient frequency mismatch between two layers of a multiplex network can lead to explosive inter-and intralayer synchronization due to mutual frustration in the completion of the synchronization processes of the layers, generating a hybrid transition without imposing any specific structure-dynamics correlation.

ABMs are an increasingly popular approach to studying complex, spatially distributed socio-environmental systems, but have still to become an established approach in the sense of being one that is expected by those wanting to explore scenarios in such systems. Partly, this is an issue of awareness - ABM is still new enough that many people have not heard of it; partly, it is an issue of confidence - ABM has more to do to prove itself if it is to become a preferred method. This paper will identify advances in the craft and deployment of ABM needed if ABM is to become an accepted part of mainstream science for policy or stakeholders. The conduct of ABM has, over the last decade, seen a transition from using abstracted representations of systems (supporting theory-led thought experiments) to more accessible representations derived empirically (to deliver more applied analysis). This has enhanced the perception of potential users of ABM outputs that the latter are salient and credible. Empirical ABM is not, however, a panacea, as it demands more computing and data resources, limiting applications to domains where data exist along with suitable environmental models where these are required. Further, empirical ABM is still facing serious questions of validation and the ontology used to describe the system in the first place. Using Geoffrey A. Moore's Crossing the Chasm as a lens, we argue that the way ahead for ABM lies in identifying the niches in which it can best demonstrate its advantages, working with collaborators to demonstrate that it can deliver on its promises. This leads us to identify several areas where work is needed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1384-6175	1573-7624		WOS:000468331900002		J	Crabtree, Stefani A.; Bird, Douglas W.; Bird, Rebecca Bliege								Subsistence Transitions and the Simplification of Ecological Networks in the Western Desert of Australia								HUMAN ECOLOGY				47	2			165	177		10.1007/s10745-019-0053-z					APR 2019	2019	The Australian desert ecosystem coevolved with humans over the course of fifty millennia, yet our understanding of the place of humans within the ecosystem is only now beginning to deepen; recent research suggests that the removal of Aboriginal people from homelands precipitated rapid ecosystem remodeling. We suggest that network-based approaches are instrumental in broadening our understanding of humans in ecosystems, so apply these approaches to examine nomadic-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people lived exclusive foraging-based lifeways) and contemporary-era ecosystems (when Aboriginal people live a mixed-based economy lifestyle). Using the approach of food web modeling we explicitly place Martu Aboriginal foragers within the overall ecosystem of the Western Desert. By linking humans to the other biota in the desert, examining each species as nodes in a network and each consumption link as edges in the network, we can better understand the ways the network connectedness shifts between nomadic-era and contemporary-era food webs. Using network randomization simulations we show that the contemporary food webs deviate significantly from the nomadic era food webs, suggesting a key role of humans as knitters of the ecosystem. This work has implications for research on resilient ecosystems, both within Australia and beyond, and suggests that humans have significant roles to play in sustainability and resilience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0300-7839	1572-9915		WOS:000468110800002		J	Wu, Yulin; Cai, Wentong; Li, Zengxiang; Tan, Wen Jun; Hou, Xiangting								Efficient Parallel Simulation over Large-scale Social Contact Networks								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION				29	2	SI				10	10.1145/3265749					APR 2019	2019	Social contact network (SCN) models the daily contacts between people in real life. It consists of agents and locations. When agents visit a location at the same time, the social interactions can be established among them. Simulations over SCN have been employed to study social dynamics such as disease spread among population. Because of the scale of SCN and the execution time requirement, the simulations are usually run in parallel. However, a challenge to the parallel simulation is that the structure of SCN is naturally skewed with a few hub locations that have far more visitors than others. These hub locations can cause load imbalance and heavy communication between partitions, which therefore impact the simulation performance. This article proposes a comprehensive solution to address this challenge. First, the hub locations are decomposed into small locations, so that SCN can be divided into partitions with better balanced workloads. Second, the agents are decomposed to exploit data locality, so that the overall communication across partitions can be greatly reduced. Third, two enhanced execution mechanisms are designed for locations and agents, respectively, to improve simulation parallelism. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed solution, an epidemic simulation was developed and extensive experiments were conducted on two computer clusters using three SCN datasets with different scales. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly improve the execution performance of the simulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1049-3301	1558-1195		WOS:000468031300003		J	Jia, Guo-Ling; Ma, Rong-Guo; Hu, Zhi-Hua								Urban Transit Network Properties Evaluation and Optimization Based on Complex Network Theory								SUSTAINABILITY				11	7					2007	10.3390/su11072007					APR 1 2019	2019	Urban public transportation contributes greatly to sustainable urban development. An urban public transportation network is a complex system. It is meaningful for theory and practice to analyze the topological structure of an urban public transportation network and explore the spatial structure of an urban transportation network so as to mitigate and prevent traffic congestion and achieve sustainability. By examining the Xi'an bus network, the degree distribution, average path length, aggregation coefficient, and betweenness centrality of the bus station network were computed using models in complex network theory. The results show that the node degrees of the Xi'an bus network are unevenly distributed and present a polarization diagram with long average path length and high aggregation. A model based on betweenness and its solution method was developed to improve the public transportation network's sustainability and discuss the possibility of optimizing the sustainability by network analyzing methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2071-1050			WOS:000466551600184		J	Nan, Lu; Liu, Tianqi; He, Chuan								Identification of transmission sections based on power grid partitioning								INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS ON ELECTRICAL ENERGY SYSTEMS				29	4					e2793	10.1002/etep.2793					APR 2019	2019	With the expansion of the power grid, the operation of power system becomes more and more complicated. Key transmission sections play an important role in the power grid, which can be considered as crucial monitoring subjects to improve the efficiency of security analysis and stability control. This paper proposes an identification method for transmission sections based on the results of the power grid partitioning, which lays the foundation for real-time monitoring and analysis of the power grid. First, key-line indicators are used to obtain important transmission lines in the power grid, which are further used to partition the power grid. The transmission lines between the subareas are obtained as tie lines. Second, the Karger method is applied to find the cut sets of the power grid, representing initial transmission sections. Finally, transmission sections are identified through screening and modification of active power flow direction. Numerical results of the 39-bus New England system and the IEEE 118-bus system show the effectiveness of the proposed method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-7038			WOS:000467882000021		J	Koprulu, Irem; Kim, Yoora; Shroff, Ness B.

Often, these opinions are of a competing nature, e.g., radical vs. peaceful ideologies, correct information vs. misinformation, and one technology vs. another. We study the battles of such competing opinions over evolving social networks. The novelty of our model is that it captures the exposure and adoption dynamics of opinions that account for the preferential and random nature of exposure as well as the persuasion power and persistence of different opinions. We provide a complete characterization of the mean opinion dynamics over time as a function of the initial adoption, as well as the particular exposure, adoption, and persistence dynamics. Our analysis, supported by case studies, reveals the key metrics that govern the spread of opinions and establishes the means to engineer the desired impact of an opinion in the presence of other competing opinions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000465307500006		J	Dong, Jian; Chen, Bin; Zhang, Pengfei; Ai, Chuan; Zhang, Fang; Guo, Danhuai; Qiu, Xiaogang								Evolution Model of Spatial Interaction Network in Online Social Networking Services								ENTROPY				21	4					434	10.3390/e21040434					APR 2019	2019	The development of online social networking services provides a rich source of data of social networks including geospatial information. More and more research has shown that geographical space is an important factor in the interactions of users in social networks. In this paper, we construct the spatial interaction network from the city level, which is called the city interaction network, and study the evolution mechanism of the city interaction network formed in the process of information dissemination in social networks. A network evolution model for interactions among cities is established. The evolution model consists of two core processes: the edge arrival and the preferential attachment of the edge. The edge arrival model arranges the arrival time of each edge; the model of preferential attachment of the edge determines the source node and the target node of each arriving edge. Six preferential attachment models (Random-Random, Random-Degree, Degree-Random, Geographical distance, Degree-Degree, Degree-Degree-Geographical distance) are built, and the maximum likelihood approach is used to do the comparison. We find that the degree of the node and the geographic distance of the edge are the key factors affecting the evolution of the city interaction network. Finally, the evolution experiments using the optimal model DDG are conducted, and the experiment results are compared with the real city interaction network extracted from the information dissemination data of the WeChat web page. The results indicate that the model can not only capture the attributes of the real city interaction network, but also reflect the actual characteristics of the interactions among cities.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000467312100106		J	Choi, Hannah; Mihalas, Stefan					Choi, Hannah/0000-0002-8192-1121			Synchronization dependent on spatial structures of a mesoscopic whole-brain network								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				15	4					e1006978	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006978					APR 2019	2019	Complex structural connectivity of the mammalian brain is believed to underlie the versatility of neural computations. Many previous studies have investigated properties of small subsystems or coarse connectivity among large brain regions that are often binarized and lack spatial information. Yet little is known about spatial embedding of the detailed whole-brain connectivity and its functional implications. We focus on closing this gap by analyzing how spatially-constrained neural connectivity shapes synchronization of the brain dynamics based on a system of coupled phase oscillators on a mammalian whole-brain network at the mesoscopic level. This was made possible by the recent development of the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas constructed from viral tracing experiments together with a new mapping algorithm. We investigated whether the network can be compactly represented based on the spatial dependence of the network topology. We found that the connectivity has a significant spatial dependence, with spatially close brain regions strongly connected and distal regions weakly connected, following a power law. However, there are a number of residuals above the power-law fit, indicating connections between brain regions that are stronger than predicted by the power-law relationship. By measuring the sensitivity of the network order parameter, we show how these strong connections dispersed across multiple spatial scales of the network promote rapid transitions between partial synchronization and more global synchronization as the global coupling coefficient changes. We further demonstrate the significance of the locations of the residual connections, suggesting a possible link between the network complexity and the brain's exceptional ability to swiftly switch computational states depending on stimulus and behavioral context.Author summary In a previous study, a data-driven large-scale model of mouse brain connectivity was constructed. This mouse brain connectivity model is estimated by a simplified model which only takes in account anatomy and distance dependence of connection strength which is best fit by a power law. The distance dependence model captures the connection strengths of the mouse whole-brain network well. But can it capture the dynamics? In this study, we show that a small number of connections which are missed by the simple spatial model lead to significant differences in dynamics. The presence of a small number of strong connections over longer distances increases sensitivity of synchronization to perturbations. Unlike the data-driven network, the network without these long-range connections, as well as the network in which these long range connections are shuffled, lose global synchronization while maintaining localized synchrony, underlining the significance of the exact topology of these distal connections in the data-driven brain network.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1553-7358		WOS:000467530600074	31013267	J	Dong, Peixin; Li, Dongyuan; Xing, Jianping; Duan, Haohui; Wu, Yong								A Method of Bus Network Optimization Based on Complex Network and Beidou Vehicle Location								FUTURE INTERNET				11	4					97	10.3390/fi11040097					APR 2019	2019	Aiming at the problems of poor time performance and accuracy in bus stops network optimization, this paper proposes an algorithm based on complex network and graph theory and Beidou Vehicle Location to measure the importance of bus stops. This method narrows the scope of points and edges to be optimized and is applied to the Jinan bus stop network. In this method, the bus driving efficiency, which can objectively reflect actual road conditions, is taken as the weight of the connecting edges in the network, and the network is optimized through the network efficiency. The experimental results show that, compared with the original network, the optimized network time performance is good and the optimized network bus driving efficiency is improved.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-5903			WOS:000467286900015		J	Mira-Iglesias, Ainara; Navarro-Pardo, Esperanza; Alberto Conejero, J.				; Mira Iglesias, Ainara/A-5453-2018	Conejero, J.

Each agent in the social network has a distinct social stress function given by a weighted sum of internal and external behavioral pressures. We assume a weighted average update rule consistent with the classic DeGroot model and prove conditions under which a connected group of agents converge to a fixed opinion distribution, and under which conditions the group reaches consensus. We show that the update rule converges to gradient descent and explain its transient and asymptotic convergence properties.

Here, we study attack robustness of complex networks with data missing caused by: 1) a uniform random sampling and 2) a nonuniform random sampling. By introducing the subgraph robustness problem, we develop analytically a framework to investigate robustness properties of the two types of subgraphs under random attacks, localized attacks, and targeted attacks. Interestingly, we find that the benchmark models, such as Erdiis-Renyi graphs, random regular networks, and scale-free networks possess distinct characteristic subgraph robustness features. We show that the network robustness depends on several factors including network topology, attack mode, sampling method and the amount of data missing, generalizing some well-known robustness principles of complex networks. Our results offer insight into the structural effect of missing data in networks and highlight the significance of understanding different sampling processes and their consequences on attack robustness, which may be instrumental in designing robust systems.									4	1	0	1	0	5			2168-2216			WOS:000461854900014		J	Zu, Jian; Gu, Yuexi; Li, Yu; Li, Chentong; Zhang, Wenyu; Zhang, Yong E.; Lee, UnJin; Zhang, Li; Long, Manyuan					Zhang, Wenyu/0000-0002-2507-3033			Topological evolution of coexpression networks by new gene integration maintains the hierarchical and modular structures in human ancestors								SCIENCE CHINA-LIFE SCIENCES				62	4			594	608		10.1007/s11427-019-9483-6					APR 2019	2019	We analyze the global structure and evolution of human gene coexpression networks driven by new gene integration. When the Pearson correlation coefficient is greater than or equal to 0.5, we find that the coexpression network consists of 334 small components and one giant connected subnet comprising of 6317 interacting genes. This network shows the properties of power-law degree distribution and small-world. The average clustering coefficient of younger genes is larger than that of the elderly genes (0.6685 vs. 0.5762). Particularly, we find that the younger genes with a larger degree also show a property of hierarchical architecture. The younger genes play an important role in the overall pivotability of the network and this network contains few redundant duplicate genes. Moreover, we find that gene duplication and orphan genes are two dominant evolutionary forces in shaping this network. Both the duplicate genes and orphan genes develop new links through a rich-gets-richer mechanism. With the gradual integration of new genes into the ancestral network, most of the topological structure features of the network would gradually increase. However, the exponent of degree distribution and modularity coefficient of the whole network do not change significantly, which implies that the evolution of coexpression networks maintains the hierarchical and modular structures in human ancestors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-7305	1869-1889		WOS:000464901000015	30919280	J	Chen, Jie; Chen, Jin-Yong; Li, Ming; Hu, Mao-Bin								Traffic dynamics considering packet loss in finite buffer networks								CHINESE PHYSICS B				28	4					048901	10.1088/1674-1056/28/4/048901					APR 2019	2019	In real complex systems, the limited storage capacity of physical devices often results in the loss of data. We study the effect of buffer size on packet loss threshold in scale-free networks. A new order parameter is proposed to characterize the packet loss threshold. Our results show that the packet loss threshold can be optimized with a relative small buffer size. Meanwhile, a large buffer size will increase the travel time. Furthermore, we propose a Buffered-Shortest-Path-First (BSPF) queuing strategy. Compared to the traditional First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy, BSPF can not only increase the packet loss threshold but can also significantly decrease the travel length and travel time in both identical and heterogeneous node capacity cases. Our study will help to improve the traffic performance in finite buffer networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1674-1056	1741-4199		WOS:000464058000001		J	Tu, Chengyi; Suweis, Samir; D'Odorico, Paolo				D'Odorico, Paolo/A-5836-2008	D'Odorico, Paolo/0000-0002-0007-5833			Impact of globalization on the resilience and sustainability of natural resources								NATURE SUSTAINABILITY				2	4			283	289		10.1038/s41893-019-0260-z					APR 2019	2019	Material flows-such as food trade-allow human societies to rely on natural resources available both locally and in other regions of the planet. Thus, in a globalized world, multiple pools of the same resource are often harvested by multiple users through a network of interactions. It is not clear to what extent the interconnectedness, structure and modularity (that is, when subsystems of nodes exhibit stronger internal connectivity) of such a network may affect the resilience of the system. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to investigate the impact of globalization on the sustainable use of natural resources for food production. We find that the resilience of the system may either increase or decrease with the network's interconnectedness and modularity, depending on the network structure. Global food trade exhibits a heterogeneous structure and its resilience is decreasing with the increase in connectivity of the past few decades.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2398-9629			WOS:000463925700014		J	Wang, Yi; Cao, Jinde; Li, Mengqi; Li, Li								Global behavior of a two-stage contact process on complex networks								JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS				356	6			3571	3589		10.1016/j.jfranklin.2019.02.020					APR 2019	2019	Masuda and Konno [14] first formulated a two-stage contact process on complex networks with heterogeneous degree distribution, and they derived a critical birth or infection rate beta(c), above which there exists a unique positive equilibrium.

In particular, by comparison arguments, we establish the global asymptotic stability of the trivial equilibrium E-0 for R-0 < 1; by constructing a bounded function, we show that the system is uniformly persistent for R-0 > 1. Furthermore, by means of a monotone iterative approach, we obtain a sufficient condition for the global asymptotic stability of the positive equilibrium E*. (c) 2019 The Franklin Institute.

In this paper, we are interested in identifying the influential users (i.e., portal nodes) in a social network under the framework of NAM. Especially, we consider the autoregression model that allows to have a heterogeneous and sparse network effect coefficients. Therefore, the portal nodes take influential powers which are corresponding to the nonzero network effect coefficients. A screening procedure is designed to screen out the portal nodes and the strong screening consistency is established theoretically. A quasi maximum likelihood method is applied to estimate the influential powers. The asymptotic normality of the resulting estimator is established. Further selection procedure is given by taking advantage of the local linear approximation algorithm. Extensive numerical studies are conducted by using a Sina Weibo dataset for illustration purpose.

This enables us to observe a qualitative difference in the behavior of the size of the largest biconnected component and the largest 2-core in the region of very small components, which is unreachable using simple sampling methods.

However, this framework is not enough for modeling extremal events, since many statistical properties of dynamical systems driven by the Wiener process are inevitably Gaussian. The goal of this work is to develop a framework that can represent a heavy-tailed distribution without losing the advantages of the Wiener process. To this end, we investigate models based on stable processes (this term "stable" has nothing to do with "dynamical stability") and clarify their fundamental properties. In addition, we propose a method for stochastic linearization, which enables us to approximately linearize static non-linearities in feedback systems under heavy-tailed noise, and analyze the resulting error theoretically. The proposed method is applied to assessing wind power fluctuation to show the practical usefulness.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9286	1558-2523		WOS:000463066600002		J	Luperto, Matteo; Amigoni, Francesco					Luperto, Matteo/0000-0002-8976-2073; Amigoni, Francesco/0000-0001-8146-6213			Predicting the global structure of indoor environments: A constructive machine learning approach								AUTONOMOUS ROBOTS				43	4			813	835		10.1007/s10514-018-9732-7					APR 2019	2019	Consider a mobile robot exploring an initially unknown school building and assume that it has already discovered some corridors, classrooms, offices, and bathrooms. What can the robot infer about the presence and the locations of other classrooms and offices and, more generally, about the structure of the rest of the building? This paper presents a system that makes a step towards providing an answer to the above question. The proposed system is based on a generative model that is able to represent the topological structures and the semantic labeling schemas of buildings and to generate plausible hypotheses for unvisited portions of these environments. We represent the buildings as undirected graphs, whose nodes are rooms and edges are physical connections between them. Given an initial knowledge base of graphs, our approach, relying on constructive machine learning techniques, segments each graph for finding significant subgraphs and clusters them according to their similarity, which is measured using graph kernels. A graph representing a new building or an unvisited part of a building is eventually generated by sampling subgraphs from clusters and connecting them.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0929-5593	1573-7527		WOS:000463116800001		J	Zhang, Yichao; Wen, Guanghui; Chen, Guanrong; Wang, Jiasheng; Xiong, Minmin; Guan, Jihong; Zhou, Shuigeng								Gaming Temporal Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				66	4			672	676		10.1109/TCSII.2018.2861621					APR 2019	2019	Temporal networks are composed of individuals with on-and-off interactions. In the study of human dynamics, a typical interaction is interpreted as a coincidental or forced concurrence of two events. Since human beings' rationality is bounded, the interaction between sentient individuals is normally investigated under the framework of game theory in the past half a century. In this brief, a game model on social networks is introduced, in which individuals play a 2 x 2 divide-and-conquer game with their neighbors, which is a specific symmetric game based on the type of their interactions. The individuals in a network play with the game with a certain strategy. The duration of a continuous interaction is defined to be the number of the continuous rounds in which at least one of them receives a non-zero payoff. On the contrary, the inter-event time is measured by the number of the continuous rounds in which both players do not receive any payoff. A detailed analytical and numerical study of the model's dynamical properties is presented, showing that it reproduces the burstiness of the human coordinating system. The findings reveal that the burstiness is inducible by rational interactions of humans. The new model and analysis shed some new lights on the origin of the burstiness of human activities.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000463067000032		J	Hens, Chittaranjan; Harush, Uzi; Haber, Simi; Cohen, Reuven; Barzel, Baruch				Cohen, Reuven/B-3875-2008; Cohen, Reuven/N-4059-2019	Cohen, Reuven/0000-0001-8788-2189; 			Spatiotemporal signal propagation in complex networks								NATURE PHYSICS				15	4			403	+		10.1038/s41567-018-0409-0					APR 2019	2019	A major achievement in the study of complex networks is the realization that diverse systems, from sub-cellular biology to social networks, exhibit universal topological characteristics. Yet, such universality does not naturally translate to the dynamics of these systems, as dynamic behaviour cannot be uniquely predicted from topology alone. Rather, it depends on the interplay of the network's topology with the dynamic mechanisms of interaction between the nodes. Hence, systems with similar structure may exhibit profoundly different dynamic behaviour. We therefore seek a general theoretical framework to help us systematically translate topological elements into their predicted dynamic outcome. Here, we offer such a translation in the context of signal propagation, linking the topology of a network to the observed spatiotemporal spread of perturbative signals across it, thus capturing the network's role in propagating local information. For a range of nonlinear dynamic models, we predict that the propagation rules condense into three highly distinctive dynamic regimes, characterized by the interplay between network paths, degree distribution and the interaction dynamics. As a result, classifying a system's intrinsic interaction mechanisms into the relevant dynamic regime allows us to systematically translate topology into dynamic patterns of information propagation.									3	0	0	0	0	3			1745-2473	1745-2481		WOS:000462874800028		J	Zhang, Na; Yang, Yu; Zheng, Yujie; Su, Jiafu								Module partition of complex mechanical products based on weighted complex networks								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING				30	4			1973	1998		10.1007/s10845-017-1367-6					APR 2019	2019	It is tough to build an effective mathematical model to describe the complicated relationships in complex mechanical products, which leads to the module partition of complex mechanical products and the guarantee of accurate results become more difficult. In addition, the module partition method cannot bring about a satisfactory module partition result if the scale of the products is huge and complicated. In this case, complex network theory is used to solve these problems in this paper. Firstly, a weighted complex network is established to systematically express the structure of complex mechanical products. In particular, customer demands are taken into account for module partition by introducing customer involvement. Secondly, the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets are used to calculate the relationships between parts for reducing the subjectivity of the calculation process. Afterwards, a modified GN algorithm (community detection algorithm) is proposed to achieve the module partition of complex mechanical products. Finally, the module partition of a wind turbine is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper. The result of the case study shows that the modified GN algorithm achieves better module partition performance than the classical GN algorithm and fuzzy clustering analysis method, which obtains a satisfactory result for applications.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0956-5515	1572-8145		WOS:000462014200029		J	Zhang, Hai-Feng; Xu, Fang; Bao, Zhong-Kui; Ma, Chuang				Zhang, Haifeng/B-2499-2012	Zhang, Haifeng/0000-0002-7094-669X			Reconstructing of Networks With Binary-State Dynamics via Generalized Statistical Inference								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS I-REGULAR PAPERS				66	4			1608	1619		10.1109/TCSI.2018.2886770					APR 2019	2019	Complex networks hosting binary-state dynamics can represent many phenomena in real world systems. Therefore, some approaches were proposed to reconstruct the structures of networks with binary-state dynamics. However, they often hold two assumptions: 1) require a priori knowledge about which state is the active state, or one state is imposed as the active state; and 2) only one side of transition probability is utilized for network reconstruction. Many binary-state dynamics, such as cooperative/defective state in evolutionary game, agree/disagree of two competing opinions, it is hard to define which state is the active state, what's more, both sides of the transition probability depend on the states of neighbors. For this situation, if we only consider one side of transition probability, the reconstruction accuracy is greatly discounted because many data are not effectively used. By abandoning the two assumptions, we here develop a generalized statistical inference approach by exploiting the expectation-maximization algorithm to reconstruct networks. Our approach requires less information regarding the dynamics, indicating more potential applications. More importantly, our approach sufficiently mines the given data, the results on empirical and synthetic networks demonstrate the high-reconstruction accuracy. In addition, the method is parameter free and robust to the stochastic fluctuations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1549-8328	1558-0806		WOS:000461874000026		J	Hall, Eric C.; Raskutti, Garvesh; Willett, Rebecca M.

For instance, each element of an observation vector could correspond to a different node in a network, and the parameters of an autoregressive model would correspond to the impact of the network structure on the time series evolution. Often, these models are used successfully in practice to learn the structure of social, epidemiological, financial, or biological neural networks. However, little is known about statistical guarantees on the estimates of such models in non-Gaussian settings. This paper addresses the inference of the autoregressive parameters and associated network structure within a generalized linear model framework that includes Poisson and Bernoulli autoregressive processes. At the heart of this analysis is a sparsity-regularized maximum likelihood estimator. While sparsity-regularization is well-studied in the statistics and machine learning communities, those analysis methods cannot be applied to autoregressive generalized linear models because of the correlations and potential heteroscedasticity inherent in the observations. Sample complexity bounds are derived using a combination of martingale concentration inequalities and modern empirical process techniques for dependent random variables. These bounds, which are supported by several simulation studies, characterize the impact of various network parameters on the estimator performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0018-9448	1557-9654		WOS:000461840600029		J	Zhang, Yaming; Su, Yanyuan; Li Weigang; Liu, Haiou								Interacting model of rumor propagation and behavior spreading in multiplex networks								CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				121				168	177		10.1016/j.chaos.2019.01.035					APR 2019	2019	Rumor propagation and behavior spreading are usually closely coupled with each other and the interaction will have great influence on the spreading dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel interacting model of rumor propagation and behavior spreading in multiplex networks. Specifically, coupled reinforcements are introduced in the derived mean-field equations to describe the interplay between these two dynamical processes. Then the basic reproduction number and the final sizes of rumor and behavior spreading are estimated. Monte Carlo simulations results show that the interacting model are much more consistent with the real data than the classical model. Besides, the attractiveness of rumor and behavior and couple reinforcements are crucial factors affecting the interactive spreading processes. Especially, influenced by the coupled reinforcements, any attractiveness increasing can enhance maximum influences and final spreading sizes of rumor and behavior simultaneously. What's more, the coupled reinforcements will extend the duration of rumor and behavior spreading. Moreover, the reinforcement of spreaders or infecteds to promote spreading is far stronger than that of stiflers and recovered to suppress spreading. Interestingly, we also find that the final size of rumor propagation is larger than that of behavior spreading, while the range of the final size variation resulting from the coupled reinforcements is opposite. This work may shed some lights on understanding the interaction between rumor and behavior and suggest a promising way to control rumors and irrational behaviors. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Concentrating on the functional information behind network structures, the community robustness has been proposed and dissected on single networks in recent studies. Currently, existing studies on the robustness of interdependent networks are limited to structural connections. As indicated by several practical dilemmas, the analyses on the invulnerability of communities and the maintenance of functional clusters in interdependent networked systems should be considered urgently. Therefore, in this paper, we first design a measure for numerically evaluating the community robustness of interdependent networks; and then guided by this measure, a memetic optimization algorithm, termed MA-CR inter, is proposed to successfully enhance the community robustness of various synthetic and real-world networks through rewiring topologies. Furthermore, two non-rewiring optimization strategies have also been modified and tested to make comparisons. The results show that these methods are valuable for enhancing networks' community robustness as well, and different optimization strategies can be selected based on actual restraints and requirements Aiming at improving the attack tolerance of communities in interdependent networks, the obtained results facilitate the information mining from networked systems and may provide potential solutions to realistic optimization problems.

However, the molecular basis of the activation of N308D mutation on SHP2 conformations is poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamic simulations were performed on SHP2 and SHP2-N308D to explore the effect of N308D mutation on SHP2 cause gain of function activity, respectively. The principal component analysis, dynamic cross-correlation map, secondary structure analysis, residue interaction networks, and solvent accessible surface area analysis suggested that the N308D mutation distorted the residues interactions network between the allosteric site (residue Gly244-Gly246) and C-SH2 domain, including the hydrogen bond formation and the binding energy. Meanwhile, the activity of catalytic site (residue Gly503-Val505) located in the Q-loop in mutant increased due to this region's high fluctuations. Therefore, the substrate had more chances to access to the catalytic activity site of the precision time protocol domain of SHP2-N308D, which was easy to be exposed. In addition, we had speculated that the Lys244 located in the allosteric site was the key residue which lead to the protein conformation changes. Consequently, overall calculations presented in this study ultimately provide a useful understanding of the increased activity of SHP2 caused by the N308D mutation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0730-2312	1097-4644		WOS:000459010100120	30304563	J	Eberhard, Lukas; Trattner, Christoph; Atzmueller, Martin					Trattner, Christoph/0000-0002-1193-0508			Predicting trading interactions in an online marketplace through location-based and online social networks								INFORMATION RETRIEVAL JOURNAL				22	1-2	SI		55	92		10.1007/s10791-018-9336-z					APR 2019	2019	Link prediction is a prominent research direction e.g.,for inferring upcoming interactions to be used in recommender systems.

In particular, we conducted the study in the context of the virtual world Second Life. For that, we crawled according data of the online social network, user information of the location-based social network obtained by specialized bots, and we extracted purchases of the trading network. Overall, we generated and used57 topological and homophilic features in different constellations to predict trading interactions between user pairs.

The iterative process of a cascading failure on scale-free networks is analysed by removing one edge. We find that the proposed new model can control the spread of cascading failure more significantly. To make our conclusions more convincing, we have explored the performance of new models in real network by the power grid of the western United States. We further give the following reasonable explanations: First, the reason why the new model shows a more stable performance than the others has been explained. Secondly, we have explored the reason why the new model shows different advantages depending on the load for different networks and lastly, we have studied the exact difference between these two methods and the network structure.

In the last years, Social Networks are being used to radicalise people. In this paper, we study the performance of a set of indicators and their respective metrics, devoted to assess the risk of radicalisation of a precise individual on three different datasets. Keyword-based metrics, even though depending on the written language, performs well when measuring frustration, perception of discrimination as well as declaration of negative and positive ideas about Western society and Jihadism, respectively. However, metrics based on frequent habits such as writing ellipses are not well enough to characterise a user in risk of radicalisation. The paper presents a detailed description of both, the set of indicators used to assess the radicalisation in Social Networks and the set of datasets used to evaluate them. Finally, an experimental study over these datasets are carried out to evaluate the performance of the metrics considered. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent empirical studies in several social contagion processes have revealed that the contagion probability is tightly controlled by the number of distinct social contexts formed by affected neighbors, rather than the actual number of exposures. Inspired by these empirical results, we propose a social contagion model with susceptible-adopted-susceptible dynamics in multi-relational networks. We incorporate the effect of distinct social contexts into our model by assuming that the contagion probability is determined by the number of layers to which an individual is exposed. Our model exhibits a rich variety of phase transitions containing continuous, discontinuous, and double transitions. We identify three universal classes of collective dynamics in the model and determine the conditions for the transitions between these classes. The bifurcation analysis shows that the transition conditions are dependent on the transmission probabilities of other layers and the probabilities of being adopted by one-layer and two-layer exposures, respectively. The theoretical results derived from Microscopic Markov-Chain Approach and mean-field theory are in good agreement with numerical simulations. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In a tree-like component with size s, there exists virtually only one shortest path between two arbitrary nodes. The summation of hopcounts of all shortest paths can be calculated approximately by the summation of the betweenness of all nodes, and the difference between them is only a constant s(s - 1). Therefore, the average hopcount can be calculated by further dividing the summation by the number of all shortest paths. In this paper, we first derive the conditional probability p(k vertical bar s) of the degree distribution of finite components with size s and the summation of all nodal betweenness respectively. By means of these results, we obtain the exact formula for calculating the average hopcount. Also, We confirm the proposed formula by simulations for networks with Poisson and power law degree distributions respectively. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Both players benefit from the successful allocation whenever the scheme presented by the proposer is endorsed by the responder, yet both receive nothing otherwise. Meanwhile, the responder in the Dictator Game has no choice but to accept what is offered by the proposer. As both games may occur in some realistic situations, we study the population dynamics by considering the mixture of the Ultimatum Game and the Dictator Game. Mixture means a fraction of individuals play the Dictator Game with their partners while others play the Ultimatum game. We introduce degree-related assignment rules to determine who shall play the Dictator Game in the heterogeneous populations. Our results show that the evolution of fairness can be promoted by assigning an appropriate fraction of hubs to be dictators, a novel finding deviating from the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium where proposers tend to leave next to nothing to their responders. Our work highlights the importance of network reciprocity in enhancing the evolution of fairness. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Since these networks are always exposed in complicated environments and may become damaged from different kinds of attacks and failures, including intentional attacks and cascading failures, many researchers have studied the models and mitigation strategies towards these two issues separately. As has been indicated by some reports and materials, the design of comprehensively robust networks against both intentional attacks and cascading failures is of significance in daily life but existing optimization methods seem to be helpless when dealing with this problem. Therefore, this paper focuses on designing such networks. A normalized measure is first designed to evaluate the comprehensive robustness of networks. Then, a multi-agent genetic algorithm is devised to search for robust structures initialized by an input network, termed MAGA-Net(R). Combining local and global optima information, the proposed algorithm is validated to be effective on synthetic and real-world networks and to outperform existing optimization methods. The optimal network designed by the proposed algorithm could facilitate theoretical analyses on networked systems and may provide potential candidates to solve some realistic dilemmas.

One such application, the friend search engine, allows the general public to query individual users' friend lists and has been gaining popularity recently. However, without proper design, this application may mistakenly disclose users' private relationship information. Our previous work has proposed a privacy preservation solution that can effectively boost OSNs' sociability while protecting users' friendship privacy against attacks launched by individual malicious requestors. In this paper, we propose an advanced collusion attack, where a victim user's friendship privacy can be compromised through a series of carefully designed queries coordinately launched by multiple malicious requestors. The effect of the proposed collusion attack is validated through synthetic and real-world social network data sets. The in-depth research on the advanced collusion attacks will help us design a more robust and secure friend search engine on OSNs in the near future.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1556-6013	1556-6021		WOS:000449082400001		J	Leon-Medini, Francisco J.								Endogenous Changes in Public Opinion Dynamics								JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION				22	2					4	10.18564/jasss.3901					MAR 31 2019	2019	Opinion dynamics models usually center on explaining how macro-level regularities in public opinion (uniformity, polarization or clusterization) emerge as the effect of local interactions of a population with an initial random distribution of opinions. However, with only a few exceptions, the understanding of patterns of public opinion change has generally been dismissed in this literature. To address this theoretical gap in our understanding of opinion dynamics, we built a multi-agent simulation model that could help to identify some mechanisms underlying changes in public opinion. Our goal was to build a model whose behavior could show different types of endogenously (not induced by the researcher) triggered transitions (rapid or slow, radical or soft). The paper formalizes a situation where agents embedded in different types of networks (random, small world and scale free networks) interact with their neighbors and express an opinion that is the result of different mechanisms: a coherence mechanism, in which agents try to stick to their previously expressed opinions; an assessment mechanism, in which agents consider available external information on the topic; and a social influence mechanism, in which agents tend to approach their neighbor's opinions. According to our findings, only scale-free networks show fluctuations in public opinion. Public opinion changes in this model appear as a diffusion process of individual opinion shifts that is triggered by an opinion change of a highly connected agent. The frequency, rapidity and radicalness of the diffusion, and hence of public opinion fluctuations, positively depends on how influential external information is in individual opinions and negatively depends on how homophilic social interactions are.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1460-7425			WOS:000462742300004		J	Wiltshire, Serge; Zia, Asim; Koliba, Christopher; Buccini, Gabriela; Clark, Eric; Merrill, Scott; Smith, Julie; Moegenburg, Susan								Network Meta-Metrics: Using Evolutionary Computation to Identify Effective Indicators of Epidemiological Vulnerability in a Livestock Production System Model								JASSS-THE JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL SOCIETIES AND SOCIAL SIMULATION				22	2					8	10.18564/jasss.3991					MAR 31 2019	2019	We developed an agent-based susceptible / infective model which simulates disease incursions in the hog production chain networks of three U.S. states. Agent parameters, contact network data, and epidemiological spread patterns are output after each model run. Key network metrics are then calculated, some of which pertain to overall network structure, and others to each node's positionality within the network. We run statistical tests to evaluate the extent to which each network metric predicts epidemiological vulnerability, finding significant correlations in some cases, but no individual metric that serves as a reliable risk indicator. To investigate the complex interactions between network structure and node positionality, we use a genetic programming (GP) algorithm to search for mathematical equations describing combinations of individual metrics - which we call "meta-metrics" - that may better predict vulnerability. We find that the GP solutions - the best of which combine both global and node - level metrics - are far better indicators of disease risk than any individual metric, with meta-metrics explaining up to 91 % of the variability in agent vulnerability across all three study areas. We suggest that this methodology could be applied to aid livestock epidemiologists in the targeting of biosecurity interventions, and also that the meta-metric approach may be useful to study a wide range of complex network phenomena.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1460-7425			WOS:000462742300008		J	Lee, Mi Jin; Lee, Deok-Sun								Understanding the temporal pattern of spreading in heterogeneous networks: Theory of the mean infection time								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	3					032309	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.032309					MAR 29 2019	2019	For a reliable prediction of an epidemic or information spreading pattern in complex systems, well-defined measures are essential. In the susceptible-infected model on heterogeneous networks, the cluster of infected nodes in the intermediate-time regime exhibits too large fluctuation in size to use its mean size as a representative value. The cluster size follows quite a broad distribution, which is shown to be derived from the variation of the cluster size with the time when a hub node was first infected. On the contrary, the distribution of the time taken to infect a given number of nodes is well concentrated at its mean, suggesting the mean infection time is a better measure. We show that the mean infection time can be evaluated by using the scaling behaviors of the boundary area of the infected cluster and use it to find a nonexponential but algebraic spreading phase in the intermediate stage on strongly heterogeneous networks. Such slow spreading originates in only small-degree nodes left susceptible, while most hub nodes are already infected in the early exponential-spreading stage. Our results offer a way to detour around large statistical fluctuations and quantify reliably the temporal pattern of spread under structural heterogeneity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000462926100009	30999425	J	Schimit, Pedro H.

More recently, a new framework has been developed to allow for multiplayer interactions of variable size in more flexible and potentially changing population structures. While the theory within this framework has been developed and simple structures considered, there has been no systematic consideration of a large range of different population structures, which is the subject of this paper. We consider a large range of underlying graphical structures for the territorial raider model, the most commonly used model in the new structure, and consider a variety of important properties of our structures with the aim of finding factors that determine the fixation probability of mutants. We find that the graphical temperature and the average group size, as previously defined, are strong predictors of fixation probability, while all other properties considered are poor predictors, although the clustering coefficient is a useful secondary predictor when combined with either temperature or group size. The relationship between temperature or average group size and fixation probability is sometimes, however, nonmonotonic, with a directional reverse occurring around the temperature associated with what we term "completely mixed" populations in the case of the hawk-dove game, but not the public goods game.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000462924200006	30999523	J	Wang, Caiyun; Han, Huawei; Han, Jing								A New Network Feature Affects the Intervention Performance on Public Opinion Dynamic Networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						5089	10.1038/s41598-019-41555-w					MAR 25 2019	2019	The neighborhood network structure plays an important role in the collective opinion of an opinion dynamic system. Does it also affect the intervention performance? To answer this question, we apply three intervention methods on an opinion dynamic model, the weighted DeGroot model, to change the convergent opinion value (x) over bar. And we define a new network feature Omega, called 'network differential degree', to measure how node degrees couple with influential values in the network, i.e., large Omega indicates nodes with high degree is more likely to couple with large influential value. We investigate the relationship between the intervention performance and the network differential degree Omega in the following three intervention cases: (1) add one special agent (shill) to connect to one normal agent; (2) add one edge between two normal agents; (3) add a number of edges among agents. Through simulations we find significant correlation between the intervention performance, i.e.,vertical bar(x) over bar*vertical bar (the maximum value of the change of convergent opinion value vertical bar(x) over bar vertical bar and Omega in all three cases: the intervention performance vertical bar( x) over bar*vertical bar is higher when Omega is smaller. So Omega could be used to predict how difficult it is to intervene and change the convergent opinion value of the weighted DeGroot model. Meanwhile, a theorem of adding one edge and an algorithm for adding optimal edges are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000462149800044	30911029	J	Nath, Keshab; Roy, Swarup								Detecting intrinsic communities in evolving networks								SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING				9	1					13	10.1007/s13278-019-0552-3					MAR 23 2019	2019	Community finding in large networks (or graphs) helps in understanding natural collaboration within a set of members in the network. An intrinsic community is a form of organization where a subset of members is highly connected with each other forming a compact group inside the original community. Extraction of intrinsic (or embedded) communities is a challenging task and yet relatively less explored. It is even more challenging when the network is dynamic in nature, where association within the members changing with the passage of time leads to a movement of members within different communities. In this work, we propose a new community detection methods InDEN (Intrinsic Community Detection in Evolving Networks) for uncovering intrinsic communities in evolving networks. We use the concept of density variation with respect to the degree of the nodes within a community. We adopt a new concept, called neighbors' push-pull, where a small degree node votes (push) for its high degree neighbors which in turn iteratively adds new members by pulling its neighbors having a same or higher degree than itself. We also derive a new membership function based on intra-community strength between nodes and their neighbors to measure the contiguity of a member towards a community. We use four synthetic and eight real-world social networks for our experimentation. We use four different contemporary community detection methods for comparison. Results show that the InDEN is superior in detecting disjoint and intrinsic communities in evolving networks with respect to six different statistical assessment parameters. Interestingly for the first time, we report the presence of intrinsic communities in PolBooks networks, detected by InDEN.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000462235000001		J	Mak, Matthew H.

As untargeted metabolomics datasets and experiments continue to increase in size and complexity, standardized workflows are often not sufficiently sophisticated. In addition, the ground truth for untargeted metabolomics experiments is intrinsically unknown and the performance of tools is difficult to evaluate. Here, the problem of dynamic multi-class metabolomics experiments was investigated using a simulated dataset with a known ground truth. This simulated dataset was used to evaluate the performance of tinderesting, a new and intuitive tool based on gathering expert knowledge to be used in machine learning. The results were compared to EDGE, a statistical method for time series data. This paper presents three novel outcomes. The first is a way to simulate dynamic metabolomics data with a known ground truth based on ordinary differential equations. This method is made available through the MetaboLouise R package. Second, the EDGE tool, originally developed for genomics data analysis, is highly performant in analyzing dynamic case vs. control metabolomics data. Third, the tinderesting method is introduced to analyse more complex dynamic metabolomics experiments. This tool consists of a Shiny app for collecting expert knowledge, which in turn is used to train a machine learning model to emulate the decision process of the expert. This approach does not replace traditional data analysis workflows for metabolomics, but can provide additional information, improved performance or easier interpretation of results. The advantage is that the tool is agnostic to the complexity of the experiment, and thus is easier to use in advanced setups. All code for the presented analysis, MetaboLouise and tinderesting are freely available.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2218-1989			WOS:000464157900001	30897797	J	Chui, Kwok Tai; Shen, Chien-wen					Chui, Kwok Tai/0000-0001-7992-9901			Tolerance analysis in scale-free social networks with varying degree exponents								LIBRARY HI TECH				37	1	SI		57	71		10.1108/LHT-07-2017-0146					MAR 18 2019	2019	Purpose There are many complex networks like World-Wide Web, internet and social networks have been reported to be scale-free. The major property of scale-free networks is their degree distributions are in power law form. Generally, the degree exponents of scale-free networks fall into the range of (2, 3). The purpose of this paper is to investigate other situations where the degree exponents may lie outside the range. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, analysis has been carried out by varying the degree exponents in the range of (0.5, 4.5). In total, 243 scenarios have been generated with varying network size of 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000, and degree exponents in the range of (0.5, 4.5) using interval of 0.05. Findings The following five indicators have been investigated: average density, average clustering coefficient, average path length, average diameter and average node degree. These indicators vary with the network size and degree exponent. If certain indicators do not satisfy with the user requirement using degree exponents of (2, 3), one can further increase or decrease the value with tradeoff. Results recommend that for degree exponents in (0.5, 2), 26 possible scale-free networks can be selected whereas for (3, 4.5), 41 possible scale-free networks can be selected, assuming a 100 percent deviation on the network parameters. Originality/value A tolerance analysis is given for the tradeoff and guideline is drawn to help better design of scale-free network for degree exponents in range of (0.5, 2) and (3, 4.5) using network size 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000. The methodology is applicable to any network size.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0737-8831			WOS:000460555700006		J	Sulaimanov, Nurgazy; Kumar, Sunil; Burdet, Frederic; Ibberson, Mark; Pagni, Marco; Koeppl, Heinz					Pagni, Marco/0000-0001-9292-9463			Inferring gene expression networks with hubs using a degree weighted Lasso approach								BIOINFORMATICS				35	6			987	994		10.1093/bioinformatics/bty716					MAR 15 2019	2019	Motivation Genome-scale gene networks contain regulatory genes called hubs that have many interaction partners. These genes usually play an essential role in gene regulation and cellular processes. Despite recent advancements in high-throughput technology, inferring gene networks with hub genes from high-dimensional data still remains a challenging problem. Novel statistical network inference methods are needed for efficient and accurate reconstruction of hub networks from high-dimensional data.Results To address this challenge we propose DW-Lasso, a degree weighted Lasso (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) method which infers gene networks with hubs efficiently under the low sample size setting. Our network reconstruction approach is formulated as a two stage procedure: first, the degree of networks is estimated iteratively, and second, the gene regulatory network is reconstructed using degree information. A useful property of the proposed method is that it naturally favors the accumulation of neighbors around hub genes and thereby helps in accurate modeling of the high-throughput data under the assumption that the underlying network exhibits hub structure. In a simulation study, we demonstrate good predictive performance of the proposed method in comparison to traditional Lasso type methods in inferring hub and scale-free graphs. We show the effectiveness of our method in an application to microarray data of Escherichia coli and RNA sequencing data of Kidney Clear Cell Carcinoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets.Availability and implementation Under the GNU General Public Licence at https://cran.r-project.org/package=DWLasso.Supplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-4803	1460-2059		WOS:000462709200011	30165436	J	Wang, Huijuan; Qu, Cunquan; Jiao, Chongze; Rusze, Wioletta					Qu, Cunquan/0000-0001-8090-2538			Self-avoiding pruning random walk on signed network								NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS				21						035001	10.1088/1367-2630/ab060f					MAR 15 2019	2019	A signed network represents how a set of nodes are connected by two logically contradictory types of links: positive and negative links. In a signed products network, two products can be complementary (purchased together) or substitutable (purchased instead of each other). Such contradictory types of links may play dramatically different roles in the spreading process of information, opinion, behaviour etc. In this work, we propose a self-avoiding pruning (SAP) random walk on a signed network to model e.g. a user's purchase activity on a signed products network. A SAP walk starts at a random node. At each step, the walker moves to a positive neighbour that is randomly selected, the previously visited node is removed and each of its negative neighbours are removed independently with a pruning probability r. We explored both analytically and numerically how signed network topological features influence the key performance of a SAP walk: the evolution of the pruned network resulted from the node removals, the length of a SAP walk and the visiting probability of each node. These findings in signed network models are further verified in two real-world signed networks. Our findings may inspire the design of recommender systems regarding how recommendations and competitions may influence consumers' purchases and products' popularity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000461517700001		J	Kooij, Robert								On generalized windmill graphs								LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS				565				25	46		10.1016/j.laa.2018.11.025					MAR 15 2019	2019	In this paper we will consider generalizations of the class of so-called windmill graphs, which were recently introduced by Estrada [6]. A windmill graph W(eta, k) consists of eta copies of the complete graph K-k, with every node connected to a common node. Estrada [6] showed that the clustering coefficient and the transitivity index of windmill graphs diverge, when the graph size tends to infinity. In addition [6] studied the spectra of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices of these graphs. In this paper we will generalize the family of windmill graphs in three ways. We will study properties for all three types of generalized windmill graphs. In particular we will focus on the behavior of the two clustering metrics. We will quantify the difference between the two metrics, under various conditions. In addition, we give the spectra of the adjacency and the Laplacian matrices of these graphs. We will also derive analytic expressions for several other graph metrics, such as average path length, heterogeneity index and a variety of robustness metrics. We also show how the generalized windmill graphs can be used to construct pairs of non-isomorphic graphs with the same number of nodes and links. Finally, we will show how generalized windmill graphs occur quite naturally in the study of public transportation networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

There are some remarkable methods for sustaining cooperation. On the other hand, various studies discuss whether human deliberative behaviour promotes or inhibits cooperation. As those studies of human behaviour develop, in the study of evolutionary game theory, models considering deliberative behaviour of game players are increasing. Based on that trend, the author considers that decision of a person requires certain time and imposes a psychological burden on him/her and defines such burden as the cost of decision. This study utilizes the model of evolutionary game theory that each player plays the spatial prisoner's dilemma game with opponent players connected to him/her and introduces the cost of decision. The main result of this study is that the introduction of the cost of decision contributes to the evolution of cooperation, although there are some differences in the extent of its contribution regarding the three types of sparse topology of connections. Regarding the distribution of the cost of decision, especially in the case of the scale-free topology of connections, players with high cost of decision, which seem to be disadvantageous at first glance, sometimes become mainstream at the last.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000461151800049	30872729	J	Inoue, Hiroyasu; Todo, Yasuyuki								Propagation of negative shocks across nation-wide firm networks								PLOS ONE				14	3					e0213648	10.1371/journal.pone.0213648					MAR 14 2019	2019	This study examines how negative shocks due to, for example, natural disasters propagate through supply chains. We apply a simulation technique to actual supply chain data covering most Japanese firms. To investigate the property of the propagation in the network, we test different types of artificial negative shocks. We find that, first, network structures severely affect the speed of propagation in the short run, and the total loss in the long run. The scale-free nature of the actual supply-chain network-that is, the power-law degree distribution-leads to faster propagation. Second, more intensive damages-that is, more damages suffered by fewer firms-result in faster propagation than extensive damages of the same total size. Third, the actual supply-chain network has innate robustness that comes from substitutability of supplies. If the supply-chain network has severe substitutability, the propagation of negative shocks becomes substantially large. Fourth, direct damages in urban regions promote faster propagation than those in rural regions. Fifth, different sectoral damages show significant differences in the speed of propagation. Finally, we check the indirect damage triggered by a single firm's loss: 9.7% of all firms contribute to significant loss, and this loss accounts for more than 10% of the damage to the entire production. The simulations conspicuously show that different direct damages, even if they have the same total magnitude of damages, can generate considerably different damages because of the structure of the supply-chain network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000461166300055	30870470	J	Sadri, Arif Mohaimin; Hasan, Samiul; Ukkusuri, Satish V.								Joint inference of user community and interest patterns in social interaction networks								SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING				9	1					11	10.1007/s13278-019-0551-4					MAR 14 2019	2019	Online social media have become an integral part of our social beings. Analyzing conversations in social media platforms can lead to complex probabilistic models to understand social interaction networks. In this paper, we present a modeling approach for characterizing social interaction networks by jointly inferring user communities and interests based on social media interactions. We present several pattern inference models: (1) interest pattern model (IPM) captures population level interaction topics, (2) user interest pattern model (UIPM) captures user specific interaction topics, and (3) community interest pattern model (CIPM) captures both community structures and user interests. We test our methods on Twitter data collected from Purdue University community. From our model results, we observe the interaction topics and communities related to two big events within Purdue University community, namely Purdue Day of Giving and Senator Bernie Sanders' visit to Purdue University as part of Indiana Primary Election 2016. Constructing social interaction networks based on user interactions accounts for the similarity of users' interactions on various topics of interest and indicates their community belonging further beyond connectivity. We observed that the degree-distributions of such networks follow power-law that is indicative of the existence of fewer nodes in the network with higher levels of interactions, and many other nodes with less interaction. We also discuss the application of such networks as a useful tool to effectively disseminate specific information to the target audience towards planning any large-scale events and demonstrate how to single out specific nodes in a given community by running network algorithms.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000461322000002		J	Tripathi, Beethika; Parthasarathy, Srinivasan; Sinha, Himanshu; Raman, Karthik; Ravindran, Balaraman								Adapting Community Detection Algorithms for Disease Module Identification in Heterogeneous Biological Networks								FRONTIERS IN GENETICS				10						164	10.3389/fgene.2019.00164					MAR 13 2019	2019	Biological networks catalog the complex web of interactions happening between different molecules, typically proteins, within a cell. These networks are known to be highly modular, with groups of proteins associated with specific biological functions. Human diseases often arise from the dysfunction of one or more such proteins of the biological functional group. The ability, to identify and automatically extract these modules has implications for understanding the etiology of different diseases as well as the functional roles of different protein modules in disease. The recent DREAM challenge posed the problem of identifying disease modules from six heterogeneous networks of proteins/genes. There exist many community detection algorithms, but all of them are not adaptable to the biological context, as these networks are densely connected and the size of biologically relevant modules is quite small. The contribution of this study is 3-fold: first, we present a comprehensive assessment of many classic community detection algorithms for biological networks to identify non-overlapping communities, and propose heuristics to identify small and structurally well-defined communities-core modules. We evaluated our performance over 180 GWAS datasets. In comparison to traditional approaches, with our proposed approach we could identify 50% more number of disease-relevant modules. Thus, we show that it is important to identify more compact modules for better performance. Next, we sought to understand the peculiar characteristics of disease-enriched modules and what causes standard community detection algorithms to detect so few of them. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the interaction patterns of known disease genes to understand the structure of disease modules and show that merely considering the known disease genes set as a module does not give good quality clusters, as measured by typical metrics such as modularity and conductance. We go on to present a methodology leveraging these known disease genes, to also include the neighboring nodes of these genes into a module, to form good quality clusters and subsequently extract a "gold-standard set" of disease modules. Lastly, we demonstrate, with justification, that "overlapping" community detection algorithms should be the preferred choice for disease module identification since several genes participate in multiple biological functions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-8021			WOS:000461121400001	30918511	J	Senekal, Burgert A.; Stemmet, Karlien								A weighted director network analysis of the big four banks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange								SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT				50	1					UNSP a386	10.4102/sajbm.v50i1.386					MAR 11 2019	2019	Background: Company director networks have been studied for many countries, including South Africa, from the perspective of network theory.

The direct connections of these companies are also identified, and findings are compared to some overseas studies.Conclusion: This study concludes that the said four major banks occupy key positions on the JSE.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2078-5585	2078-5976		WOS:000466338800001		J	Haruna, Taichi; Gunji, Yukio-Pegio					Haruna, Taichi/0000-0002-1774-217X			Ordinal Preferential Attachment: A Self-Organizing Principle Generating Dense Scale-Free Networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						4130	10.1038/s41598-019-40716-1					MAR 11 2019	2019	Networks are useful representations for analyzing and modeling real-world complex systems. They are often both scale-free and dense: their degree distribution follows a power-law and their average degree grows over time. So far, it has been argued that producing such networks is difficult without externally imposing a suitable cutoff for the scale-free regime. Here, we propose a new growing network model that produces dense scale-free networks with dynamically generated cutoffs. The link formation rule is based on a weak form of preferential attachment depending only on order relations between the degrees of nodes. By this mechanism, our model yields scale-free networks whose scaling exponents can take arbitrary values greater than 1. In particular, the resulting networks are dense when scaling exponents are 2 or less. We analytically study network properties such as the degree distribution, the degree correlation function, and the local clustering coefficient. All analytical calculations are in good agreement with numerical simulations.

Minicolumns are the elementary computational units of the mature neocortex. Here, we use zinc oxide nanowires with controlled topography as substrates for neural-cell growth. We observe that neuronal cells form networks where the networks characteristics exhibit a high sensitivity to the topography of the nanowires. For certain values of nanowires density and fractal dimension, neuronal networks express small world attributes, with enhanced information flows. We observe that neurons in these networks congregate in superclusters of approximately 200 neurons. We demonstrate that this number is not coincidental: the maximum number of cells in a supercluster is limited by the competition between the binding energy between cells, adhesion to the substrate, and the kinetic energy of the system. Since cortical minicolumns have similar size, similar anatomical and topological characteristics of neuronal superclusters on nanowires surfaces, we conjecture that the formation of cortical minicolumns is likewise guided by the interplay between energy minimization, information optimization and topology. For the first time, we provide a clear account of the mechanisms of formation of the minicolumns in the brain.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000460751300004	30858456	J	Scudero, Salvatore; De Guidi, Giorgio; Gudmundsson, Agust								Size distributions of fractures, dykes, and eruptions on Etna, Italy: Implications for magma-chamber volume and eruption potential								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						4139	10.1038/s41598-019-40563-0					MAR 11 2019	2019	The main magma source for eruptions on Etna (Italy) is poorly constrained. Here we use data on the size distributions of volcanic fissures/feeder-dykes, crater cones, dyke thicknesses, and lava flows to estimate the average magma volume flowing out of the chamber during eruptions and the volume of the chamber. For the past four centuries the average magma volume leaving the chamber during each eruption is estimated at 0.064 km(3). From the theory of poroelasticity the estimated chamber volume is then between 69 and 206 km(3). For comparison, a sill-like, circular chamber (an oblate ellipsoid) 1 km thick and 14 km in diameter would have a volume of about 154 km(3). The elastic strain energy stored in the host rock during inflation of such a chamber is about 2.8 x 10(14) J. Estimating the surface energy of a typical dyke-fracture as about 10(7) J m(-2), the results suggest that the stored strain energy is sufficient to generate a dyke-fracture with an area of about 28 km(2). The average strike-dimension of volcanic fissures/feeder-dykes in Etna is about 2.7 km. It follows that the estimated strain energy is sufficient to generate a feeder-dyke with a strike-dimension of 2-3 km and with a dip-dimension as great as 10 km, agreeing with the maximum estimated depth of the magma chamber.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000460754600030	30858418	J	Isakov, Alexander; Fowler, James H.; Airoldi, Edoardo M.; Christakis, Nicholas A.								The Structure of Negative Social Ties in Rural Village Networks								SOCIOLOGICAL SCIENCE				6				197	218		10.15195/v6.a8					MAR 6 2019	2019	Negative (antagonistic) connections have been of longstanding theoretical importance for social structure. In a population of 24,696 adults interacting face to face within 176 isolated villages in western Honduras, we measured all connections that were present, amounting to 105,175 positive and 16,448 negative ties. Here, we show that negative and positive ties exhibit many of the same structural characteristics. We then develop a complete taxonomy of all 138 possible triads of two-type relationships. Consistent with balance theory, we find that antagonists of friends and friends of antagonists tend to be antagonists; but, in an important empirical refutation of balance theory, we find that antagonists of antagonists also tend to be antagonists, not friends. Finally, villages with comparable levels of animosity tend to be geographically proximate. Similar processes, involving social contact, give rise to both positive and negative social ties in rural villages, and negative ties play an important role in social structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2330-6696			WOS:000462430900001		J	Memon, Bilal Ahmed; Yao, Hongxing								Structural Change and Dynamics of Pakistan Stock Market during Crisis: A Complex Network Perspective								ENTROPY				21	3					248	10.3390/e21030248					MAR 5 2019	2019	We studied the cross-correlations in the daily closing prices of 181 stocks listed on the Pakistan stock exchange (PSX) covering a time period of 2007-2017 to compute the threshold networks and minimum spanning trees. In addition to the full sample analysis, our study uses three subsamples to examine the structural change and topological evolution before, during, and after the global financial crisis of 2008. We also apply Shannon entropy on the overall sample to measure the volatility of individual stocks. Our results find substantial clustering and a crisis-like less stable overall market structure, given the external and internal events of terrorism, political, financial, and economic crisis for Pakistan. The subsample results further reveal hierarchal scale-free structures and a reconfigured metastable market structure during a postcrisis period. In addition, time varying topological measures confirm the evidence of the presence of several star-like structures, the shrinkage of tree length due to crisis-related shocks, and an expansion in the recovery phase. Finally, changes of the central node of minimum spanning trees (MSTs), the volatile stock recognition using Shannon entropy, and the topology of threshold networks will help local and international investors of Pakistan Stock Exchange limited (PSX) to manage their portfolios or regulators to monitor the important nodes to achieve stability and to predict an upcoming crisis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000464385500001		J	Sirbu, Alina; Pedreschi, Dino; Giannotti, Fosca; Kertesz, Janos				Sirbu, Alina/I-3288-2014	Sirbu, Alina/0000-0002-3947-7143			Algorithmic bias amplifies opinion fragmentation and polarization: A bounded confidence model								PLOS ONE				14	3					e0213246	10.1371/journal.pone.0213246					MAR 5 2019	2019	The flow of information reaching us via the online media platforms is optimized not by the information content or relevance but by popularity and proximity to the target. This is typically performed in order to maximise platform usage. As a side effect, this introduces an algorithmic bias that is believed to enhance fragmentation and polarization of the societal debate. To study this phenomenon, we modify the well-known continuous opinion dynamics model of bounded confidence in order to account for the algorithmic bias and investigate its consequences. In the simplest version of the original model the pairs of discussion participants are chosen at random and their opinions get closer to each other if they are within a fixed tolerance level. We modify the selection rule of the discussion partners: there is an enhanced probability to choose individuals whose opinions are already close to each other, thus mimicking the behavior of online media which suggest interaction with similar peers. As a result we observe: a) an increased tendency towards opinion fragmentation, which emerges also in conditions where the original model would predict consensus, b) increased polarisation of opinions and c) a dramatic slowing down of the speed at which the convergence at the asymptotic state is reached, which makes the system highly unstable. Fragmentation and polarization are augmented by a fragmented initial population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000460371800033	30835742	J	Broido, Anna D.; Clauset, Aaron					CLAUSET, AARON/0000-0002-3529-8746			Scale-free networks are rare								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				10						1017	10.1038/s41467-019-08746-5					MAR 4 2019	2019	Real-world networks are often claimed to be scale free, meaning that the fraction of nodes with degree k follows a power law k(-alpha), a pattern with broad implications for the structure and dynamics of complex systems. However, the universality of scale-free networks remains controversial. Here, we organize different definitions of scale-free networks and construct a severe test of their empirical prevalence using state-of-the-art statistical tools applied to nearly 1000 social, biological, technological, transportation, and information networks. Across these networks, we find robust evidence that strongly scale-free structure is empirically rare, while for most networks, log-normal distributions fit the data as well or better than power laws. Furthermore, social networks are at best weakly scale free, while a handful of technological and biological networks appear strongly scale free. These findings highlight the structural diversity of real-world networks and the need for new theoretical explanations of these non-scale-free patterns.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2041-1723			WOS:000460125000006	30833554	J	Holme, Petter								Rare and everywhere: Perspectives on scale-free networks								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				10						1016	10.1038/s41467-019-09038-8					MAR 4 2019	2019	Are scale-free networks rare or universal?

We introduce a simple model, which uses the priority attachment to generate both synthetic and close to empirical networks. Priority attachment is a mechanism, which generalizes previously proposed mechanisms, such as small world creation or preferential attachment, but we also observe its presence in a range of real-world networks. In this paper, we show that by using priority attachment we can generate networks of very diverse topologies, as well as re-create empirical ones. An additional advantage of the priority attachment mechanism is an easy interpretation of the latent processes of network formation. We substantiate our claims by performing numerical experiments on both synthetic and empirical networks. The two main contributions of the paper are: the development of the priority attachment mechanism, and the design of Priority Rank: a simple network generative model based on the priority attachment mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000460123600055	30833611	J	Wang, Cao; Feng, Kairui; Zhang, Hao; Li, Quanwang				Wang, Cao/O-7942-2018	Wang, Cao/0000-0002-2802-1394			Seismic performance assessment of electric power systems subjected to spatially correlated earthquake excitations								STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING				15	3			351	361		10.1080/15732479.2018.1547766					MAR 4 2019	2019	Electric power systems play a critical role in assuring modern society's functionalities. Earthquakes are one of the most destructive natural hazards that affect the serviceability of electricity transmission systems. The earthquake excitations applied to each component of a power system (e.g. plants, substations and transmission lines) are spatially correlated by nature due to common causes. Yet, limited attention has been paid to the impact of this spatial correlation on the power grid seismic performance. This article presents an approach for estimating the seismic performance of large-scale electric power systems subjected to spatially correlated earthquake ground motions. The network flow theory is used to model the power flow allocation over the grid components, and a stochastic ground motion model is employed to represent the spatial characteristics of earthquake excitations. The proposed method is illustrated through the seismic performance assessment of the national power grid of Italy. The overall vulnerability is measured and evaluated through a proposed metric, and the critical components of the grid system are identified. The impact of spatial correlation of earthquake ground motion on the grid system's post-hazard performance is also investigated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1573-2479	1744-8980		WOS:000461398500005		J	Laurence, Edward; Doyon, Nicolas; Dube, Louis J.; Desrosiers, Patrick								Spectral Dimension Reduction of Complex Dynamical Networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW X				9	1					011042	10.1103/PhysRevX.9.011042					MAR 4 2019	2019	Dynamical networks are powerful tools for modeling a broad range of complex systems, including financial markets, brains, and ecosystems. They encode how the basic elements (nodes) of these systems interact altogether (via links) and evolve (nodes' dynamics). Despite substantial progress, little is known about why some subtle changes in the network structure, at the so-called critical points, can provoke drastic shifts in its dynamics. We tackle this challenging problem by introducing a method that reduces any network to a simplified low-dimensional version. It can then be used to describe the collective dynamics of the original system. This dimension reduction method relies on spectral graph theory and, more specifically, on the dominant eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the network adjacency matrix. Contrary to previous approaches, our method is able to predict the multiple activation of modular networks as well as the critical points of random networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Our results are of both fundamental and practical interest, as they offer a novel framework to relate the structure of networks to their dynamics and to study the resilience of complex systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2160-3308			WOS:000460666300001		J	Tian, Jing; Yu, Mengting; Ren, Chang; Lei, Yingzhe								Network-scape metric analysis: a new approach for the pattern analysis of urban road networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE				33	3			537	566		10.1080/13658816.2018.1545234					MAR 4 2019	2019	The spatial patterns of road networks reflect the morphological and structural characteristics of cities. Previous studies have focused mainly on seeking universal laws in road networks rather than explaining their differences. A new approach for road network pattern analysis is proposed that has been inspired by landscape metric analysis. The utility of this approach is illustrated through (but is not limited to) the extraction of the main factors in network landscapes, or network-scapes for short. Twenty-four metrics were calculated for network-scapes of 100 cities worldwide, before an exploratory analysis is performed to detect the main factors. Four main factors were revealed and may be regarded as the characteristic indicators of road networks, which were identified to be evenness, richness-density, shape irregularity, and size and shape variation. The meanings of these factors are explained, and their spatial distributions are illustrated. Compared to existing road network analytics, these factors depict better the characteristic differences of road networks. The proposed approach provides a new framework for road network pattern analysis from a cellular perspective.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1365-8816	1362-3087		WOS:000454832600006		J	Liu, Chengliang; Niu, Caicheng; Han, Ji				Liu, Chengliang/L-8419-2017	Liu, Chengliang/0000-0003-4692-2994			Spatial Dynamics of Intercity Technology Transfer Networks in China's Three Urban Agglomerations: A Patent Transaction Perspective								SUSTAINABILITY				11	6					1647	10.3390/su11061647					MAR 2 2019	2019	Technology transfer has become a vital pipeline for acquiring external knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to portray the spatial dynamics of intercity technology transfer networks in China's three urban agglomerations based on patent right transaction data from 2008 to 2015. The integration of social networks and spatial visualization is used to explore spatial networks and influencing variables of the networks. The results demonstrate that Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen are emerging as hubs in the three urban agglomerations. The spatial distributions of degree and weighted degree are significantly heterogeneous and hierarchical. The larger cities play the role of a knowledge and technology incubator, highly related to their economic scale, research and development (R&D) input, and innovation output. The evolution of intercity technology linkages is driven by the networking mechanisms of preferential attachment, hierarchical and contagious diffusion, path dependence, and path breaking. Moreover, we found that the geographical proximity and technology gaps are determinants of the strength of intercity technology linkages. As a result, it has been discovered that the network in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei agglomeration is organized in a tree network, while the Yangtze River Delta features a polycentric network and the Pearl River Delta has multi-star characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2071-1050			WOS:000465613000102		J	Turner, Liam D.; Whitaker, Roger M.; Allen, Stuart M.; Linden, David E.

Using a dataset of usage behaviour from 53 participants over a six-week period, we find strong similarity in the structure of networks built from app switching, despite diversity in the apps used, and the volume of app switching. App switch networks exhibit small-world, broad-scale network features, with a rapid popularity decay, suggesting that preferential attachment may drive next-app decision-making.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2054-5703			WOS:000465470300075	31032058	J	Lyocsa, Stefan; Vyrost, Tomas; Baumohl, Eduard								Return spillovers around the globe: A network approach								ECONOMIC MODELLING				77				133	146		10.1016/j.econmod.2017.11.003					MAR 2019	2019	We study the connectedness of a sample of 40 stock markets across five continents using daily dosing prices and return spillovers based on Granger causality. All possible 1560 return spillovers between 40 markets create a complex network of relationships between equity markets around the world. Apart from analyzing the topological and time-varying properties of the created networks, we also identify the determinants of the connectedness of equity markets over time. Adjusting for non-synchronous trading, our modelling approach leads to evidence that the probability of return spillover from a given stock market to other markets increases with market volatility and market size and decreases with higher foreign exchange volatility. We empirically show that the temporal proximity between closing hours is important for information propagation; therefore, choosing markets that trade during similar hours bears an additional risk to investors because the probability of return spillovers increases.

Whenever this happens, it further increases the popularity advantage of the inferior choice, compelling subsequent decision makers to follow suit. The author argues that despite this positive feedback effect, discordances between popularity and quality will usually self-correct. Reanalyzing past experimental studies in which social information initially heavily favored inferior options, the author shows that in each experiment superior alternatives gained in popularity. This article also reports on a new experiment in which a larger number of subject choices allowed trials to be run to convergence and shows that in each trial the superior alternative eventually achieved popular dominance. To explain the persistent dominance of bestsellers, celebrities, and memes of seemingly questionable quality in everyday life in terms of social influence processes, one must identify conditions that render positive feedback so strong that self-correcting dynamics are prevented.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-9602	1537-5390		WOS:000466383300004		J	Snijders, Tom A.

A fundamental mechanism is homophily or assortativity, where actors have a higher likelihood to be tied with others having similar values of the variable under study. But there are other mechanisms that may also play a role in how the attribute values of two actors influence the likelihood of a tie between them. We discuss three additional mechanisms: aspiration, the tendency to send more ties to others having high values; attachment conformity, sending more ties to others whose values are close to the "social norm"; and sociability, where those having higher values will tend to send more ties generally. These mechanisms may operate jointly, and then their effects will be confounded. We present a specification representing these effects simultaneously by a four-parameter quadratic function of the values of sender and receiver. Flexibility can be increased by a five-parameter extension. We argue that for numerical actor attributes having important effects on directed networks, these specifications may provide an improvement. An illustration is given of dependence of advice ties on academic grades, analyzed by the Stochastic Actor-oriented Model.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-1242	2050-1250		WOS:000465959300001		J	Wu, Jianshe; Shen, Xing; Jiao, Kui					Wu, Jianshe/0000-0003-0021-7456			Game-Based Memetic Algorithm to the Vertex Cover of Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS				49	3			974	988		10.1109/TCYB.2018.2789930					MAR 2019	2019	The minimum vertex cover (MVC) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. A game-based memetic algorithm (GMA-MVC) is provided, in which the local search is an asynchronous updating snowdrift game and the global search is an evolutionary algorithm (EA). The game-based local search can implement (k,l)-exchanges for various numbers of k and l to remove k vertices from and add I vertices into the solution set, thus is much better than the previous (1,0)-exchange. Beyond that, the proposed local search is able to deal with the constraint, such that the crossover operator can he very simple and efficient. Degree-based initialization method is also provided which is much better than the previous uniform random initialization. Each individual of the GMA-MVC is designed as a snowdrift game state of the network. Each vertex is treated as an intelligent agent playing the snowdrift game with its neighbors, which is the local refinement process. The game is designed such that its strict Nash equilibrium (SNE) is always a vertex cover of the network. Most of the SNEs are only local optima of the problem. Then an EA is employed to guide the game to escape from those local optimal Nash equilibriums to reach a better Nash equilibrium. From comparison with the state of the art algorithms in experiments on various networks, the proposed algorithm always obtains the best solutions.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000458655900021	29994575	J	Berkhout, Joost; Heidergott, Bernd F.

Regarding the Human gammaherpesvirus 4 or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), miRNAs are important regulators of viral and cellular gene expression during the infectious process, promoting viral persistence and, in some cases, oncogenic processes. We identified 55 miRNAs of EBV type 2 and inferred the viral mRNA target to self-regulate. This data indicate that gene self-repression is an important strategy for maintenance of the viral latent phase. In addition, a protein network was constructed to establish essential proteins in the self-regulation process. We found ten proteins that work as hubs, highlighting BTRF1 and BSRF1 as the most important proteins in the network. These results open a new way to understand the infection by EBV type 2, where viral genes can be targeted for avoiding oncogenic processes, as well as new therapies to suppress and combat the persistent viral infection.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0046-8991	0973-7715		WOS:000455445400010	30728633	J	Paulin, James; Calinescu, Anisoara; Wooldridge, Michael								Understanding flash crash contagion and systemic risk: A micro-macro agent-based approach								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC DYNAMICS & CONTROL				100				200	229		10.1016/j.jedc.2018.12.008					MAR 2019	2019	The purpose of this paper is to advance the understanding of the conditions that give rise to flash crash contagion, particularly with respect to overlapping asset portfolio crowding. To this end, we designed, implemented, and assessed a hybrid micro-macro agent-based model, where price impact arises endogenously through the limit order placement activity of algorithmic traders. Our novel hybrid microscopic and macroscopic model allows us to characterise systemic risk not just in terms of system stability, but also in terms of the speed of financial distress propagation over intraday timescales. We find that systemic risk is strongly dependent on the behaviour of algorithmic traders, on leverage management practices, and on network topology. Our results demonstrate that, for high-crowding regimes, contagion speed is a non-monotone function of portfolio diversification. We also find the surprising result that, in certain circumstances, increased portfolio crowding is beneficial to systemic stability. We are not aware of previous studies that have exhibited this phenomenon, and our results establish the importance of considering non-uniform asset allocations in future studies. Finally, we characterise the time window available for regulatory interventions during the propagation of flash crash distress, with results suggesting ex ante precautions may have higher efficacy than ex post reactions.

In this research, we calculate the Granger causality relationship between different steel products in different markets and the midstream industry chain. We then construct the global steel product price transmission network and regional price transmission network. We analyze the network indicators and draw the following conclusions. First, emerging economies play a major role in international steel product price transmission activities. Second, billet and plates of middle thickness transmit the most price in the steel market. Third, China imposes price transmission impacts on the most regions with the widest range. Lastly, steel products at the end of the midstream steel industrial chain are "bridges" of price transmission activities. This research will guide market individuals in the steel industry to adjust their behaviors according to market signals.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-4207	1873-7641		WOS:000463120100006		J	Ji, Jiaojiao; Barnett, George A.; Chu, Jianxun					JI, JIAOJIAO/0000-0003-1571-6135			Global networks of genetically modified crops technology: a patent citation network analysis								SCIENTOMETRICS				118	3			737	762		10.1007/s11192-019-03006-1					MAR 2019	2019	This paper employs the patent data of four major genetically modified (GM) crops, soybeans, cotton, maize and rapeseed, to illustratee how the innovation of GM crop technology diffused and distributed globally over time. Data collected from the Derwent Innovation Index, were employed to construct country patent citation networks, from 1984 to 2015, and the results revealed that developed countries were early adopters, and the primary actors in the innovation of GM crop technology. Only seven developing countries appeared in the country citation network. Most developed countries were reluctant to apply GM crop technology for commercial cultivation. Private businesses stood out in the patent citation network. The early adoption and better performance of developed countries can be explained by the activities of large established private companies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000460804500002		J	Aparo, Antonino; Bonnici, Vincenzo; Micale, Giovanni; Ferro, Alfredo; Shasha, Dennis; Pulvirenti, Alfredo; Giugno, Rosalba					bonnici, vincenzo/0000-0002-1637-7545; Giugno, Rosalba/0000-0001-9843-7638			Fast Subgraph Matching Strategies Based on Pattern-Only Heuristics								INTERDISCIPLINARY SCIENCES-COMPUTATIONAL LIFE SCIENCES				11	1	SI		21	32		10.1007/s12539-019-00323-0					MAR 2019	2019	Many scientific applications entail solving the subgraph isomorphism problem, i.e., given an input pattern graph, find all the subgraphs of a (usually much larger) target graph that are structurally equivalent to that input. Because subgraph isomorphism is NP-complete, methods to solve it have to use heuristics. This work evaluates subgraph isomorphism methods to assess their computational behavior on a wide range of synthetic and real graphs. Surprisingly, our experiments show that, among the leading algorithms, certain heuristics based only on pattern graphs are the most efficient.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1913-2751	1867-1462		WOS:000460843200003	30790228	J	Liu, Pengfei; Feng, Minyu; Liu, Ming								Practical k-agents search algorithm towards information retrieval in complex networks								WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS				22	2	SI		885	905		10.1007/s11280-018-0527-8					MAR 2019	2019	Spanking information retrieval in large-scale Web and network has attracted increasing interest in the research community, many typical approaches have been recalled such as greedy, random-walk and high degree seeking since the search capabilities of complex networks are proved by Kleinberg in 2000. Unfortunately, the retrieval efficiency of these classic approaches is not ideal, and they are only suitable for the specific networks due to their defects. The motivation of this paper is to increase the retrieval efficiency, and we thus proposed a novel k-agents search approach for different types of networks which searches the networks with k-agents, simultaneously. Besides, to better test the efficiency of algorithms, a new evaluation method which considers search steps and query information both is put forward to measure the cost of the search algorithm. The complexity analysis also will be discussed, and the comparison with other algorithms will be displayed in detail to show its superiority. In the end, for the purpose of displaying a universe application of our algorithm, the simulations in WS (proposed by Watts and Strogatz), NW (proposed by Newman and Watts) small-world and BA (proposed by Barabai and Albert) scale-free network model are carried out to illustrate the performance of the proposed method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-145X	1573-1413		WOS:000462231500025		J	Eckl, Markus; Ghanem, Christian; Loewenstein, Heiko								The Evolution of Social Work from Disconnected Groups to a Scientific Community: A Social Network Analysis								BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK				49	2			428	447		10.1093/bjsw/bcy050					MAR 2019	2019	This study investigates the collaboration networks within the social work discipline using the recently established Social Work Research Database. By means of network-analysis methods, we investigate the collaborations between 1990 and 2014, while the nodes of this network represent social work scholars (N=19,789) connected by edges representing common publications (N=314,180). We analyse the structural characteristics of these co-authorship networks and how they changed over time. The results show an increase in scientific collaborations among social work scholars and an evolution from mainly disconnected groups to a collaborating scientific community, while the network shows a small-world structure. The findings also reveal the existence of the so-called Matthew effect within the social work discipline. Specifically, nodes with a high number of connections are associated with a higher probability of acquiring new connections than other nodes, as well as becoming hubs. We therefore argue that an inequality is constantly reproduced and growing over time that implies barriers especially for early-career researchers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0045-3102	1468-263X		WOS:000462720700010		J	Li, Rongpeng; Zhao, Zhifeng; Zhong, Yi; Qi, Chen; Zhang, Honggang				Zhong, Yi/N-5612-2019	Zhong, Yi/0000-0001-5584-0988; Zhang, Honggang/0000-0003-1492-1364			The Stochastic Geometry Analyses of Cellular Networks With alpha-Stable Self-Similarity								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS				67	3			2487	2503		10.1109/TCOMM.2018.2883099					MAR 2019	2019	To understand the spatial deployment of base stations (BSs) is the first step to analyze the performance of cellular networks and further design efficient networking protocols. Poisson point process (PPP), which has been widely adopted to characterize the deployment of BSs and established the reputation to give tractable results in the stochastic geometry analyses, usually assumes a static BS deployment density in homogeneous PPP (HPPP) models or delicately designed location-dependent density functions in in-homogeneous PPP models. However, the simultaneous existence of attractiveness and repulsiveness among BSs practically deployed in a large-scale area defies such an assumption, and the alpha-stable distribution, one kind of heavy-tailed distributions, has recently demonstrated superior accuracy to statistically model the varying BS density in different areas. In this paper, we start with these new findings and investigate the intrinsic feature (i.e., the spatial self-similarity) embedded in the BSs. Afterwards, we refer to a generalized PPP setup with alpha-stable distributed density and theoretically derive the related coverage probability. In particular, we give an upper bound of the derived coverage probability for high signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio thresholds and show the monotonically decreasing property of this bound with respect to the variance of BS density. Besides, we prove that our model could reduce to the single-tier HPPP for some special cases and demonstrate the superior accuracy of the alpha-stable model to approach the real environment.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0090-6778	1558-0857		WOS:000461844500055		J	Eletreby, Rashad; Yagan, Osman					Yagan, Osman/0000-0002-7057-2966			Connectivity of Wireless Sensor Networks Secured by Heterogeneous Key Predistribution Under an On/Off Channel Model								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL OF NETWORK SYSTEMS				6	1			225	235		10.1109/TCNS.2018.2808141					MAR 2019	2019	We investigate the connectivity of a wireless sensor network (WSN) secured by the heterogeneous key predistribution scheme under an independent on/off channel model. The heterogeneous scheme induces an inhomogeneous random key graph, denoted by K(n; mu, K, P) and the on/off channel model induces an Erdds-Renyi graph, denoted by H(n, alpha). Hence, the overall random graph modeling the WSN is obtained by the intersection of K ( n; mu, K. P) and H (n, alpha). We present conditions on how to scale the parameters of the intersecting graph with respect to the network size n such that the graph i) has no isolated nodes and ii) is connected, both with high probability (whp) as the number of nodes gets large. Our results are supported by a simulation study demonstrating that i) despite their asymptotic nature, our results can in fact be useful in designing finite - node WSNs so that they achieve secure connectivity whp; and ii) despite the simplicity of the on/off communication model, the probability of connectivity in the resulting WSN approximates very well the case where the disk model is used.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2325-5870	2372-2533		WOS:000461857300020		J	Maeng, Seong Eun; Lee, Jae Woo; Lee, Deok-Sun								Competition-induced increase of species abundance in mutualistic networks								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										033502	10.1088/1742-5468/ab0549					MAR 2019	2019	Nutrients from a flowering plant are shared by its pollinators, giving rise to competition in the latter. Such exploitative competition of pollinators can limit their abundance and affect the global organization of the mutualistic partnership in the plant-pollinator mutualistic community. Here we investigate the effects of the exploitative competition between pollinators on the structure and the species abundance of the mutualistic networks which evolve by changing mutualistic partnership towards higher abundance of species. Simulations show different emergent network characteristics between plants and animals; hub plants connected to many pollinators are very rare while a few super-hub pollinators appear with the exploitative competition included, in contrast to equally many hubs of both types without the exploitative competition. More interestingly, the abundance of plant species increases with increasing the exploitative competition strength. We analyze the inverse of the generalized interaction matrix in the weak-interaction limit to identify the leading structural factors relevant to the species abundance, which are shown to be instrumental in optimizing the network structure to increase the mutualistic benefit and lower the cost of exploitative competition.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000461825900001		J	Nair, Anand; Reed-Tsochas, Felix								Revisiting the complex adaptive systems paradigm: Leading perspectives for researching operations and supply chain management issues								JOURNAL OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				65	2	SI		80	92		10.1002/joom.1022					MAR 2019	2019	This paper presents a conceptual model for a renewed consideration of the complex adaptive systems (CAS) perspective in operations and supply chain management research.

Viewing supply chain networks as complex adaptive systems, we first construct and analyze a real-world supply chain network among 2,971 firms spanning 90 industry sectors. We then develop an agent-based simulation to show how the model of firms' adaptive behaviors can leverage competition relationships within a supply chain network. The simulation also models how disruptions propagate in the supply chain network through cascading failures. With the simulation, we seek to understand if a firm's adaptive behaviors can reduce the impact of disruptions in supply chain networks. Therefore, we propose, evaluate, and analyze two types of adaptive strategies a firm can leverage to reduce the negative effects of supply chain network disruptions. First, we deploy in our model a reactive strategy, which restructures the network in response to a disruption event among first-tier suppliers. Next, we develop and propose proactive strategies, which are used when a distant disruption is observed but has not yet hit the focal firm. We discuss the implications related to how and when firms can improve their resilience against supply disruptions by leveraging adaptive strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0272-6963	1873-1317		WOS:000462356600006		J	Beringer, Dorottya; Timar, Adam								Controllability, Matching Ratio and Graph Convergence								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS				174	5			1080	1103		10.1007/s10955-019-02225-3					MAR 2019	2019	There is an important parameter in control theory which is closely related to the directed matching ratio of the network, as shown in the paper of Liu et al. (Nature 473:167-173,2011). We give proofs of two main statements of Liu et al. (2011) on the directed matching ratio, which were based on numerical results and heuristics from statistical physics. First, we show that the directed matching ratio of directed random networks given by a fix sequence of degrees is concentrated around its mean. We also examine the convergence of the (directed) matching ratio of a random (directed) graph sequence that converges in the local weak sense, and generalize the result of Elek and Lippner (Proc Am Math Soc 138(8):2939-2947, 2010). We prove that the mean of the directed matching ratio converges to the properly defined matching ratio parameter of the limiting graph. We further show the almost sure convergence of the matching ratios for the most widely used families of scale-free networks, which was the main motivation of Liu et al. (2011).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-4715	1572-9613		WOS:000460654900007	30930485	J	Hasan, Mohammad Rashedul; Raja, Anita; Bazzan, Ana								A context-aware convention formation framework for large-scale networks								AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS				33	1-2			1	34		10.1007/s10458-018-9397-9					MAR 2019	2019	In this article, we present a decentralized convention formation framework for creating social conventions within large multiagent convention spaces. We study the role of the topological characteristics of the network in forming conventions with an emphasis on scale-free topologies. We hypothesize that contextual knowledge encapsulated in the topology can help improve both the quality of the emergent convention and the speed of forming such a convention. We also investigate the influence of network diversity. While recent research on diversity indicates that it improves organizational productivity, we observe that not all diversity is equally useful and identify the necessary conditions to maximize the benefit of diversity. We validate our convention formation framework using a language coordination problem in which agents in a multiagent system construct a common lexicon in a decentralized fashion. Agent interactions are modeled using a language game where every agent repeatedly plays with its neighbors. Each agent stochastically updates its lexicon based on the utility values of the lexicons received from its immediate neighbors. We introduce a novel context-aware utility computation mechanism and equip the agents with the ability to reorganize their neighborhood based on this utility estimate to expedite the convention formation process. A key idea behind our approach is the ability of socially influential high-utility-lexicon agents to bias their neighbors towards accepting their lexicons. Extensive experimentation results indicate that our proposed solution is both effective (able to converge into a large majority convention state with more than 90% agents sharing a high-quality lexicon) and efficient (faster) as compared to state-of-the-art approaches for social conventions in large convention spaces.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1387-2532	1573-7454		WOS:000461140300001		J	Pal, Ranjan; Golubchik, Leana; Psounis, Konstantinos; Hui, Pan								Security Pricing as Enabler of Cyber-Insurance A First Look at Differentiated Pricing Markets								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON DEPENDABLE AND SECURE COMPUTING				16	2			358	372		10.1109/TDSC.2017.2684801					MAR-APR 2019	2019	Despite the promising potential of network risk management services (e.g., cyber-insurance) to improve information security, their deployment is relatively scarce, primarily due to such service companies being unable to guarantee profitability. As a novel approach to making cyber-insurance services more viable, we explore a symbiotic relationship between security vendors (e.g., Symantec) capable of price differentiating their clients, and cyber-insurance agencies having possession of information related to the security investments of their clients. The goal of this relationship is to (i) allow security vendors to price differentiate their clients based on security investment information from insurance agencies, (ii) allow the vendors to make more profit than in homogeneous pricing settings, and (iii) subsequently transfer some of the extra profit to cyber-insurance agencies to make insurance services more viable. In this paper, we perform a theoretical study of a market for differentiated security product pricing, primarily with a view to ensuring that security vendors (SVs) make more profit in the differentiated pricing case as compared to the case of non-differentiated pricing. In order to practically realize such pricing markets, we propose novel and computationally efficient consumer differentiated pricing mechanisms for SVs based on (i) the market structure, (ii) the communication network structure of SV consumers captured via a consumer's Bonacich centrality in the network, and (iii) security investment amounts made by SV consumers. We validate our analytical model via extensive simulations conducted on practical SV client network topologies; main results show (through those simulations) that (a) a monopoly SV could improve its profit margin by upto approximate to 25 percent (based on the simulation setting) by accounting for clients' investment information and network locations, whereas in an oligopoly setting, SVs could improve their profit margins by upto approximate to 18 percent, and (b) differentiated security pricing mechanisms are fair among SV consumers with respect to the total investment made by a consumer. To the best of knowledge, the proposed differentiated pricing framework is the first of its kind in the security products domain, and is generally applicable to usecases beyond the one investigated in this work.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1545-5971	1941-0018		WOS:000461357500013		J	Zhou, Jin; Yu, Xinghuo; Lu, Jun-An				Yu, Xinghuo/D-8423-2013	Yu, Xinghuo/0000-0001-8093-9787			Node Importance in Controlled Complex Networks								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				66	3			437	441		10.1109/TCSII.2018.2845940					MAR 2019	2019	The problem of node importance in a general controlled complex network is investigated in this brief. An index, ControlRank index, to measure the node importance is presented. The index is relatively intuitive and helps unify various indexes that are effective only in the networks with some particular topology. If all nodes except one are pinned in a network, the importance of the unpinned node is sorted in descending order of degree; even if a node is the most significant node, it does not necessarily belong to the most efficient node set; it is very crucial to have an eye on the information balance as for information dissemination in a network; it is reasonable to rank node importance by sorting the node degrees in a scale-free network. The results and phenomena provide us with a broader and clearer perspective to view node importance in complex networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000460427700025		J	Luo, Jianxi; Whitney, Daniel E.								The Hierarchy-Niche Model for Supply Networks								PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT				28	3			668	681		10.1111/poms.12945					MAR 2019	2019	Contemporary products are usually designed and produced in large inter-firm supply networks rather than by single firms. However, our understanding of such networks is still limited due to the lack of network-wide empirical data as well as the complexity and nonlinearity of supply networks. Herein, we introduce a network formation model to extend and generalize the prior empirical studies that have revealed variable hierarchy topologies and firm-level transaction specificities across the supply networks for automobiles and electronics. We call it the "hierarchy-niche model." With tuning the parameters for transaction specificity and transaction breadth, the model can generate a wide spectrum of stochastic networks that comply with the production hierarchy to varied degrees. Our simulation analyses show that the model-generated stochastic networks capture hierarchical and cyclic topologies of real-world automobile and electronics supply networks. The model, which relates firm-level transaction patterns to network-wide emergent topologies, can be further utilized to inform and guide firms' transaction strategies concerning the overall supply network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1059-1478	1937-5956		WOS:000460781800010		J	Buchanan, Briggs; Andrews, Brian; Kilby, J.

Settling into the country: Comparison of Clovis and Folsom lithic networks in western North America shows increasing redundancy of toolstone use								JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY				53				32	42		10.1016/j.jaa.2018.10.004					MAR 2019	2019	The Peopling of the Americas was a multi-millennium process involving both the hunter-gatherer colonization of new landscapes as well as the 'settling in' to local environments. This process is typically identified archaeologically by an increase in the number of recognized point types, site frequency, changes in subsistence patterns, and increased geographic patterning in stone tool variation. Here, we add to this list by examining preferential toolstone use by Clovis and Folsom peoples, reasoning that Folsom groups formed stricter habits of toolstone procurement relative to Clovis people as the former pursued their increasingly familiar seasonal rounds. After generating lithic raw material data from 49 Folsom assemblages, we constructed a 'Folsom lithic network' that we compared to a 'Clovis lithic network', which consisted of 38 assemblages. Our results show that the Folsom lithic network is significantly denser than the Clovis lithic network. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that Folsom people started to form regular habits of toolstone procurement relative to Clovis people. More broadly, our comparison of lithic networks further supports the hypothesis that the Clovis-to-Folsom transition represents the process of foragers increasingly adapting to their local resource distribution.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0278-4165	1090-2686		WOS:000460195800003		J	Soltan, Saleh; Loh, Alexander; Zussman, Gil					Zussman, Gil/0000-0002-1845-4460			A Learning-Based Method for Generating Synthetic Power Grids								IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL				13	1			625	634		10.1109/JSYST.2018.2825785					MAR 2019	2019	Analysis and improvement of power grids resilience and efficiency requires the topologies and geographical coordinates of the real transmission networks. However, due to security reasons, such topologies and particularly the locations of the substations and lines are usually not publicly available. In this work, we thoroughly study the structural properties of the U.S. Western Interconnection grid (WI) and, based on the results, present the network imitating method based on learning (NIMBLE) for generating synthetic spatially embedded networks with similar properties to a given grid. We apply NIMBLE to the WI and show that it can generate networks with similar structural and spatial properties as well the same level of robustness to failures to the WI, without revealing the real locations of the lines and substations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider the spatial distributions of the buses (nodes) and lines and their importance in generating synthetic grids.

At the same time, a believer prefers to make friend with other people of the same faith, and thus people of different faiths tend to form relatively isolated communities. The segregation between different religions is a major factor for many social conflicts. However, quantitative understanding of religious segregation is rare. Here we analyze a directed social network extracted from weibo.com (the largest directed social network in China, similar to twitter.com), which is consisted of 6875 believers in Christianity, Buddhism, Islam and Taoism. This religion network is highly segregative. Comparative analysis shows that the extent of segregation for different religions is much higher than that for different races and slightly higher than that for different political parties. Furthermore, we study the few cross-religion links and find 46.7% of them are probably related to charitable issues. Our findings provide quantitative insights into religious segregation and valuable evidence for religious syncretism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2193-1127			WOS:000460065400001		J	Balkundi, Prasad; Wang, Lei; Kishore, Rajiv								Teams as boundaries: How intra-team and inter-team brokerage influence network changes in knowledge-seeking networks								JOURNAL OF ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR				40	3			325	341		10.1002/job.2331					MAR 2019	2019	What role does an ego's brokerage location-within a team (intra-team) or outside the team (inter-team)-play in the evolution of an instrumental knowledge-seeking network in terms of both proximal (i.e., within the team) and distal (i.e., outside the team) tie formation and tie decay? We address this question by drawing on literature about social networks, brokerage, and teams. We use temporally separated data from 302 students embedded in 97 teams to test our hypotheses about the impacts of intra-team and inter-team brokerage on proximal and distal network evolution, specifically on four network changes in knowledge-seeking networks: proximal tie formation, proximal tie decay, distal tie formation, and distal tie decay. We find that these four changes depend on individual network brokerage location even after controlling for personality and task characteristics. Specifically, inter-team brokers change their networks both within and outside their teams, whereas intra-team brokers curtail their network changes. We argue that these opposite effects occur because inter-team brokers have greater autonomy than intra-team brokers. This study adds to the ongoing dialog about network evolution in social network literature and to the conversations about brokerage and its location in the context of team-based work.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0894-3796	1099-1379		WOS:000459944600007		J	Shi, Yongbin; Li, Le; Wang, Yougui; Chen, Jiawei; Yuan, Yida; Stanley, H.

Regional surname affinity: A spatial network approach								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY				168	3			428	437		10.1002/ajpa.23755					MAR 2019	2019	Objective We investigate surname affinities among areas of modern-day China, by constructing a spatial network, and making community detection. It reports a geographical genealogy of the Chinese population that is result of population origins, historical migrations, and societal evolutions. Materials and methods We acquire data from the census records supplied by China's National Citizen Identity Information System, including the surname and regional information of 1.28 billion registered Chinese citizens. We propose a multilayer minimum spanning tree (MMST) to construct a spatial network based on the matrix of isonymic distances, which is often used to characterize the dissimilarity of surname structure among areas. We use the fast unfolding algorithm to detect network communities. Results We obtain a 10-layer MMST network of 362 prefecture nodes and 3,610 edges derived from the matrix of the Euclidean distances among these areas. These prefectures are divided into eight groups in the spatial network via community detection. We measure the partition by comparing the inter-distances and intra-distances of the communities and obtain meaningful regional ethnicity classification. Discussion The visualization of the resulting communities on the map indicates that the prefectures in the same community are usually geographically adjacent. The formation of this partition is influenced by geographical factors, historic migrations, trade and economic factors, as well as isolation of culture and language. The MMST algorithm proves to be effective in geo-genealogy and ethnicity classification for it retains essential information about surname affinity and highlights the geographical consanguinity of the population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0002-9483	1096-8644		WOS:000458409000002	30586153	J	Song, Hyunjin; Nyhuis, Dominic; Boomgaarden, Hajo								A Network Model of Negative Campaigning: The Structure and Determinants of Negative Campaigning in Multiparty Systems								COMMUNICATION RESEARCH				46	2	SI		273	294		10.1177/0093650217712596					MAR 2019	2019	Scholarly attention to the nature and extent of negative campaigning in nonmajoritarian multiparty systems is steadily growing. While prior studies have made commendable progress in outlining the conditions and consequences of negative campaigning, they have typically disregarded the complex interdependencies of multiactor communication environments. The present study focuses on network-structural determinants of negative campaigning. It does so by relying on unique data from the 2013 Austrian federal election and using exponential random graph models to investigate patterns of mediated negative campaigning. We find that-above and beyond common determinants of negative campaigning-indicators of network structure are important predictors of campaign communication. This suggests that network models are crucial for accurately representing campaign communication patterns in multiparty systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0093-6502	1552-3810		WOS:000458866800006		J	Aguinaga, Salvador; Chiang, David; Weninger, Tim								Learning Hyperedge Replacement Grammars for Graph Generation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE				41	3			625	638		10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2810877					MAR 2019	2019	The discovery and analysis of network patterns are central to the scientific enterprise. In the present work, we developed and evaluated a new approach that learns the building blocks of graphs that can be used to understand and generate new realistic graphs. Our key insight is that a graph's clique tree encodes robust and precise information. We show that a Hyperedge Replacement Grammar (HRG) can be extracted from the clique tree, and we develop a fixed-size graph generation algorithm that can be used to produce new graphs of a specified size. In experiments on large real-world graphs, we show that graphs generated from the HRG approach exhibit a diverse range of properties that are similar to those found in the original networks. In addition to graph properties like degree or eigenvector centrality, what a graph "looks like" ultimately depends on small details in local graph substructures that are difficult to define at a global level. We show that the HRG model can also preserve these local substructures when generating new graphs.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0162-8828	1939-3539		WOS:000458168800008	29994579	J	Frieze, Alan; Perez-Gimenez, Xavier; Pralat, Pawel; Reiniger, Benjamin								Perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles in the preferential attachment model								RANDOM STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS				54	2			258	288		10.1002/rsa.20778					MAR 2019	2019	In this paper, we study the existence of perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles in the preferential attachment model. In this model, vertices are added to the graph one by one, and each time a new vertex is created it establishes a connection with m random vertices selected with probabilities proportional to their current degrees. (Constant m is the only parameter of the model.) We prove that if m >= 1253, then asymptotically almost surely there exists a perfect matching. Moreover, we show that there exists a Hamiltonian cycle asymptotically almost surely, provided that m >= 29 500. One difficulty in the analysis comes from the fact that vertices establish connections only with vertices that are "older" (ie, are created earlier in the process). However, the main obstacle arises from the fact that edges in the preferential attachment model are not generated independently. In view of that, we also consider a simpler setting-sometimes called uniform attachment-in which vertices are added one by one and each vertex connects to m older vertices selected uniformly at random and independently of all other choices. We first investigate the existence of perfect matchings and Hamiltonian cycles in the uniform attachment model, and then extend the argument to the preferential attachment version.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1042-9832	1098-2418		WOS:000458197400003		J	Hernandez, Exequiel; Shaver, J.

Network synergy is the extent to which combining an acquirer's and a target's networks through node collapse results in a more favorable structural position for the combined firm as the acquirer gains control of the target's existing ties. We hypothesize that the likelihood of selecting a target increases when the expected network synergy is greater. Using data from the biotechnology industry (1995-2007), we find support for this hypothesis by showing that acquirers prefer targets that generate greater expected increases in network status and greater expected access to structural holes-even when we control for other known sources of synergies. We further show that these effects are driven by complementary combinations of the acquirer's and target's networks that go beyond the attractiveness of the target's network per se. By integrating the networks and acquisitions literatures, we introduce a novel source of synergies, provide evidence of a previously unexplored mechanism of network change, and show how firms can exert agency in the process of network change.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0001-8392	1930-3815		WOS:000457485900009		J	Jeong, Wonhee; Yu, Unjong								Prisoner's dilemma game on complex networks with a death process: Effects of minimum requirements and immigration								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				517				47	52		10.1016/j.physa.2018.10.039					MAR 1 2019	2019	We present results of the prisoner's dilemma game on complex networks that have population change.

We show that the acceptable number of immigrants of the society is determined by the population of the society, the ratio of cooperator among immigrants, and the immigration interval. In addition, if immigrants have a preferential attachment link, the acceptable number of immigrants increases. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Growth in both web users and varieties of online objects has been observed. In this paper, we propose a growth model for online emerging user-object bipartite networks to investigate selection behaviors of web users. According to model, both sets of users and objects grow constantly but edges arrive only from user set. The network evolves by arrival of external edges brought by new users and/or internal edges from old users. These external and internal edges are attached with a combination of preferential and random attachment mechanism. We have considered different attachment procedures for external edges of new users and internal edges of old users. To validate our model, we have taken nine different real online networks with distinct objects. Our results show good agreement between empirical data and theoretical model. We report mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for the proposed growth model. We emphasize on significant inferences about selection behaviors of web users after interpreting parameters' values of the model. We also report detailed analysis of randomness in selection of new and old users that gives interesting inferences for each of the considered online networks.

Static robustness of networks under intentional attacks analyses the ability of a system to maintain its connectivity after the disconnection or deletion of a series of targeted nodes. In this context, connectivity is typically measured by the size of the remaining largest connected component. When targeting these nodes, previous literature has mostly used adaptive strategies that sequentially remove central nodes, or created heuristics in order to improve the results of the adaptive strategies. The proposed methodology based on mathematical programming allows to identify, for every fraction of disconnected or removed nodes, the set that minimizes the size of the largest connected component of a network, i.e. it allows to calculate the exact (most critical) robustness of a network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0951-8320	1879-0836		WOS:000455693700022		J	Gong, Yuhui; Yu, Qian								Evolution of Conformity Dynamics in Complex Social Networks								SYMMETRY-BASEL				11	3					299	10.3390/sym11030299					FEB 28 2019	2019	Conformity is a common phenomenon among people in social networks. In this paper, we focus on customers' conformity behaviors in a symmetry market where customers are located in a social network. We establish a conformity model and analyze it in ring network, random network, small-world network, and scale-free network. Our simulations shown that topology structure, network size, and initial market share have significant effects on the evolution of customers' conformity behaviors. The market will likely converge to a monopoly state in small-world networks but will form a duopoly market in scale networks. As the size of the network increases, there is a greater possibility of forming a dominant group of preferences in small-world network, and the market will converge to the monopoly of the product which has the initial selector in the market. Also, network density will become gradually significant in small-world networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-8994			WOS:000464402600004		J	Sreedharan, Jithin K.; Magner, Abram; Grama, Ananth; Szpankowski, Wojciech								Inferring Temporal Information from a Snapshot of a Dynamic Network								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						3057	10.1038/s41598-019-38912-0					FEB 28 2019	2019	The problem of reverse-engineering the evolution of a dynamic network, known broadly as network archaeology, is one of profound importance in diverse application domains. In analysis of infection spread, it reveals the spatial and temporal processes underlying infection. In analysis of biomolecular interaction networks (e.g., protein interaction networks), it reveals early molecules that are known to be differentially implicated in diseases. In economic networks, it reveals flow of capital and associated actors. Beyond these recognized applications, it provides analytical substrates for novel studies - for instance, on the structural and functional evolution of the human brain connectome. In this paper, we model, formulate, and rigorously analyze the problem of inferring the arrival order of nodes in a dynamic network from a single snapshot. We derive limits on solutions to the problem, present methods that approach this limit, and demonstrate the methods on a range of applications, from inferring the evolution of the human brain connectome to conventional citation and social networks, where ground truth is known.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000459891700067	30816140	J	Wang, Jing; Li, Youguo; Tan, Yusong; Wu, Qingbo; Wu, Quanyuan								Analysis of Open Source Operating System Evolution: A Perspective from Package Dependency Network Motif								SYMMETRY-BASEL				11	3					298	10.3390/sym11030298					FEB 27 2019	2019	Complexity of open source operating systems constantly increase on account of their widespread application. It is increasingly difficult to understand the collaboration between components in the system. Extant research of open source operating system evolution is mainly achieved by Lehman's law, which is conducted by analyzing characteristics such as line of the source code. Networks, which are utilized to demonstrate relationships among entities, is an adequate model for exploring cooperation of units that form a software system. Software network has become a research hotspot in the field of software engineering, leading to a new viewpoint for us to estimate evolution of open source operating systems. Motif, a connected subgraph that occurs frequently in a network, is extensively used in other scientific research such as bioscience to detect evolutionary rules. Thus, this paper constructs software package dependency network of open source software operating systems and investigates their evolutionary discipline from the perspective of the motif. Results of our experiments, which took Ubuntu Kylin as a study example, indicate a stable evolution of motif change as well as discovering structural defect in that system.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-8994			WOS:000464403200001		J	Medina, Jan A.; Finke, Jorge; Roche, Camilo					Finke, Jorge/0000-0003-2393-6066; Rocha, Camilo/0000-0003-4356-7704; Medina Lopez, Jan Alejandro/0000-0002-5115-0098			Estimating formation mechanisms and degree distributions in mixed attachment networks								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL				52	9					095001	10.1088/1751-8121/aaffeb					FEB 27 2019	2019	Our work introduces an approach for estimating the contribution of attachment mechanisms to the formation of growing networks. We present a generic model in which growth is driven by the continuous attachment of new nodes according to random and preferential linkage with a fixed probability. Past approaches apply likelihood analysis to estimate the probability of occurrence of each mechanism at a particular network instance, exploiting the concavity of the likelihood function at each point in time. However, the probability of connecting to existing nodes, and consequently the likelihood function itself, varies as networks grow. We establish conditions under which applying likelihood analysis guarantees the existence of a local maximum of the time-varying likelihood function and prove that an expectation maximization algorithm provides a convergent estimate. Furthermore, the in-degree distributions of the nodes in the growing networks are analytically characterized. Simulations show that, under the proposed conditions, expectation maximization and maximum-likelihood accurately estimate the actual contribution of each mechanism, and in-degree distributions converge to stationary distributions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8113	1751-8121		WOS:000457855100001		J	Sampaio, Adalberto R., Jr.; Rubin, Julia; Beschastnikh, Ivan; Rosa, Nelson S.

Microservice-based applications (mu Apps) rely on message passing for communication and to decouple each microservice, allowing the logic in each service to scale independently.Complex mu Apps can contain hundreds of microservices, complicating the ability of DevOps engineers to reason about and automatically optimize the deployment. In particular, the performance and resource utilization of a mu App depends on the placement of the microservices that compose it. However, existing tools for mu Apps, like Kubernetes, provide minimal ability to influence the placement and utilization of a mu App deployment.In this paper, we first identify the runtime aspects of microservice execution that impact the placement of microservices in a mu App. We then review the challenges of reconfiguring a mu App based on these aspects. Our main contribution is an adaptation mechanism, named REMaP, to manage the placement of microservices in an mu App automatically. To achieve this, REMaP uses microservice affinities and resource usage history. We evaluate our REMaP prototype and demonstrate that our solution is autonomic, lowers resource utilization, and can substantially improve mu App performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1867-4828	1869-0238		WOS:000459921200001		J	Dai, Hao; Jia, Jinping; Yan, Li; Wang, Fakui; Chen, Weisheng								Event-triggered exponential synchronization of complex dynamical networks with cooperatively directed spanning tree topology								NEUROCOMPUTING				330				355	368		10.1016/j.neucom.2018.11.013					FEB 22 2019	2019	This paper focuses on the exponential synchronization problem of complex dynamical networks (CDNs) with time-varying network topology via event-triggered communication strategy. The definition of a new time-varying network topology, called cooperatively directed spanning tree topology, is first given based on the integral of time-varying Laplacian matrix. This topology does not require the network constantly connected. In other words, the network topology is allowed to be disconnected at all times, but only the integral of the Laplacian matrix of the network graph is required to contain directed spanning tree over a period of time. Moreover, in order to achieve the exponential synchronization for CDNs under the cooperatively directed spanning tree topology, a sufficient condition is derived by the virtues of algebraic graph theory, event-triggered communication strategy, matrix inequality and the special Lyapunov stability analysis method. Additionally, event-triggered communication strategy can avoid continuous communication, which can reduce the communication load and energy consumption. The Zeno behavior is excluded as well by the strictly positive sampling intervals based on the upper right-hand Dini derivative, and thus to avoid infinite triggers. Finally, simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed exponential synchronization criteria. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

According to the construction of the networks, we study two types of random walks in the weighted directed networks with a trap fixed on the central node, i.e., standard random walks and mixed random walks. For the standard random walks, the trapping process is controlled by a weight parameter w which changes the transition probability of random walks. For the mixed random walks including non-nearest-neighbor hopping, the trapping process is steered by a stochastic parameter theta, where theta changes the walking rule. For the above two techniques, we derive both analytically the average trapping time (ATT) as the measure of trapping efficiency, and the obtained analytical expressions are in good agreement with the corresponding numerical solutions for different values of w and theta. The obtained results indicate that ATT scales superlinearly with network size N-n and the weight parameter w changes simultaneously the prefactor and the leading scalings of ATT, while the stochastic parameter theta can only alter the prefactor of ATT and leave the leading scalings of ATT unchanged. This work may help in paving the way for understanding the effects of the link weight and nonnearest-neighbor hopping in real complex systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000461229400011		J	Li, Wenguo; Li, Yong; Tan, Yi; Cao, Yijia; Chen, Chun; Cai, Ye; Lee, Kwang Y.; Pecht, Michael								Maximizing Network Resilience against Malicious Attacks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						2261	10.1038/s41598-019-38781-7					FEB 19 2019	2019	The threat of a malicious attack is one of the major security problems in complex networks. Resilience is the system-level self-adjusting ability of a complex network to retain its basic functionality and recover rapidly from major disruptions. Despite numerous heuristic enhancement methods, there is a research gap in maximizing network resilience: current heuristic methods are designed to immunize vital nodes or modify a network to a specific onion-like structure and cannot maximize resilience theoretically via network structure. Here we map complex networks onto a physical elastic system to introduce indices of network resilience, and propose a unified theoretical framework and general approach, which can address the optimal problem of network resilience by slightly modifying network structures (i.e., by adding a set of structural edges). We demonstrate the high efficiency of this approach on three realistic networks as well as two artificial random networks. Case studies show that the proposed approach can maximize the resilience of complex networks while maintaining their topological functionality. This approach helps to unveil hitherto hidden functions of some inconspicuous components, which in turn, can be used to guide the design of resilient systems, offer an effective and efficient approach for mitigating malicious attacks, and furnish self-healing to reconstruct failed infrastructure systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000459092800031	30783193	J	Malod-Dognin, Noel; Petschnigg, Julia; Windels, Sam F.

We construct iCells of four cancers and the corresponding tissue controls and identify the most rewired genes in cancer. Many of them are of unknown function and cannot be identified as different in cancer in any specific molecular network. We biologically validate that they have a role in cancer by knockdown experiments followed by cell viability assays. We find additional support through Kaplan-Meier survival curves of thousands of patients. Finally, we extend this analysis to uncover pan-cancer genes. Our methodology is universal and enables integrative comparisons of diverse omics data over cells and tissues.									2	0	0	1	0	2			2041-1723			WOS:000458864600008	30778056	J	Du, Wenju; Li, Yinzhen; Zhang, Jiangang; Yu, Jianning								Synchronisation between two different networks with multi-weights and its application in public traffic network								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE				50	3			534	545		10.1080/00207721.2018.1563223					FEB 17 2019	2019	The paper established a conventional bus traffic network and a subway network by using the method of space R based on the existing public traffic network model.

Every edge of this model's two sub-networks has one or several different property weights, and the coupling edges between two sub-networks have one weight. Based on the method of network split, the paper splits the complex networks with multi-weights into several different single-weighted two-layer-coupled public traffic networks and then investigates its global synchronisation.

Comprised of small nucleotide sequences, microRNAs have demonstrated critical and broad regulatory roles in the pathogenesis of PH via the direct binding to messenger RNA transcripts for degradation or inhibition of translation, thereby exerting a profound influence on cellular activity. Yet, as inherently pleiotropic molecules, microRNAs have been difficult to study using traditional, reductionist approaches alone. With the advent of high-throughput -omics technologies and more advanced computational modelling, the study of microRNAs and their multi-faceted and complex functions in human disease serves as a fertile platform for the application of systems biology methodologies in combination with traditional experimental techniques. Here, we offer our viewpoint of past successes of systems biology in elucidating the otherwise hidden actions of microRNAs in PH, as well as areas for future development to integrate these strategies into the discovery of RNA pathobiology in this disease. We contend that such successful applications of systems biology in elucidating the functional architecture of microRNA regulation will further reveal the molecular mechanisms of disease, while simultaneously revealing potential diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in disease amelioration.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0022-3751	1469-7793		WOS:000458676000024	30113078	J	Bossier, Kevin E.; Freyl, Erwin; Zia, R.

This happens, for example, in rock-paper-scissors games or conserved Lotka-Volterra models in which every pair of individuals can interact on a complete graph. Here we show that if the competing individuals also have a "social temperament" to be either introverted or extroverted, leading them to cut or add links, respectively, then long-living states in which all species coexist can occur. These nonequilibrium quasisteady states only occur when both introverts and extroverts are present, thus showing that diversity can lead to stability in complex systems. In this case, it enables a subtle balance between species competition and network dynamics to be maintained.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000458822200001	30934283	J	Li, Mingchu; Jin, Xing; Guo, Cheng; Liu, Jia; Cui, Guanghai; Qiu, Tie								RIMNet: Recommendation Incentive Mechanism based on evolutionary game dynamics in peer-to-peer service networks								KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS				166				156	169		10.1016/j.knosys.2018.12.024					FEB 15 2019	2019	In peer-to-peer service networks, autonomous agents gain utilities through getting services from others. However, providing services is so costly that rational agents may prefer to defect rather than to cooperate. In order to provide scalable and robust services in such networks, incentive mechanisms need to be introduced. In this paper, we propose a novel approach RIM (Recommendation Incentive Mechanism) by building a cooperative agents recommendation system. And, in order to investigate the acceptance and performance of the proposed RIM, evolutionary game theory has been used. By studying the evolutionary stable state, we demonstrate the performance of the RIM-based model by both considering two scenarios PRIM/IRIM (Perfect/Imperfect Recommendation Incentive Mechanism). To comprehensively confirm the robustness of our mechanism: (1) OCMP (One Consumer Multi-service Providers) method has been discussed, in which agent could simultaneously request services from k (k > 1) different agents; (2) a FS (Four-Strategies) game model has been further introduced; (3) QS (Quantity Sensitivity) scenario has been researched, in which the utility of an agent is sensitive to the amount of received services. By using the Lyapunov stability theory, it is qualitatively proved that non-cooperative agents can be well suppressed in our proposed RIM. Finally, extensive numerical and simulation experiments are conducted to highlight the performance and validate the theoretical properties of our model. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, both intra-traffic and inter-traffic coexist in these systems. In this paper, we study such kind of hybrid traffic flow considering three coupling mechanisms: (i) assortative coupling, (ii) disassortative coupling, and (ii) the newly proposed anti-assortative coupling. The results show that the anti-assortative coupling can achieve higher traffic capacity, especially when the inter-traffic level is high. The traffic capacity of system exhibits non-monotonic behavior with the coupling strength. With the anti-assortative coupling mechanism, the system capacity can be improved at an optimized coupling strength of beta approximate to 0.3. We further propose an index called effective betweenness, based on which the traffic capacity of such coupled systems can be theoretically predicted. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In the standard MV, one of the simplest nonequilibrium systems exhibiting an order-disorder phase transition, spins are aligned with their local majority with probability 1 - f, and with complementary probability f, the majority rule is not followed. In the noisy MV (NMV), a random spin flip is succeeded with probability p (with complementary 1 - p the usual MV rule is accomplished). Such extra ingredient was considered by Vieira and Crokidakis (2016) for the square lattice. Here, we generalize the NMV for arbitrary networks, including homogeneous [random regular (RR) and Erdos-Renyi (ER)] and heterogeneous [Barabasi-Albert (BA)] structures, through mean-field calculations and numerical simulations. Results coming from both approaches are in excellent agreement with each other, revealing that the presence of additional noise does not affect the classification of phase transition, which remains continuous irrespective of the network degree and its distribution. The critical point and the threshold probability P-t marking the disappearance of the ordered phase depend on the node distribution and increase with the connectivity k. The critical behavior, investigated numerically, exhibits a common set of critical exponents for RR and ER topologies, but different from BA and regular lattices. Finally, our results indicate that (in contrary to a previous proposition) there is no first-order transition in the NMV for large k. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

They are also intimately related to the solution of differential equations describing dynamical processes on graphs and networks. Here, we propose a new matrix function based on the Gaussianization of the adjacency matrix of a graph. This function gives more weight to a selected reference eigenvalue A(ref), which may be located in any region of the graph spectra. We show here that this matrix function can be derived from physical models that consider the interactions between nearest and next-nearest neighbors in the graph. We first obtain a few mathematical results for the trace of this matrix function when lambda(ref) = -1 (H-1) for simple graphs as well as for random graphs. We also provide a combinatorial interpretation of this index in terms of subgraphs in the graph, and in terms of the competition pressure among agents in a complex system. Finally, we apply this index to the study of magnetic properties of molecules emerging due to spin interactions as well as to studying the temporal evolution of the international trade network in the period 1992-2002. In both cases we give a clear phenomenological interpretation of the processes described. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This is why the focus of the literature on theoretical models for real-world networks shifted from classic models without geometry, such as Chung-Lu random graphs, to modern geometry-based models, such as hyperbolic random graphs.With this paper we contribute to the theoretical analysis of these modern, more realistic random graph models. Instead of studying directly hyperbolic random graphs, we use a generalization that we call geometric inhomogeneous random graphs (GIRGs). Since we ignore constant factors in the edge probabilities, GIRGs are technically simpler (specifically, we avoid hyperbolic cosines), while preserving the qualitative behavior of hyperbolic random graphs, and we suggest to replace hyperbolic random graphs by this new model in future theoretical studies.We prove the following fundamental structural and algorithmic results on GIRGs. (1) We provide a sampling algorithm that generates a random graph from our model in expected linear time, improving the best-known sampling algorithm for hyperbolic random graphs by a substantial factor O (root n). (2) We establish that GIRGs have clustering coefficients in Omega(1), (3) we prove that GIRGs have small separators, i.e., it suffices to delete a sublinear number of edges to break the giant component into two large pieces, and (4) we show how to compress GIRGs using an expected linear number of bits.

However, our understanding of the network structure of the world's largest HSR system remains largely incomplete due to the limited data available. In this study, a publicly available data source, namely, information from a ticketing website, was used to collect an exhaustive dataset on the stations and routes within the Chinese HSR system. The dataset included all 704 HSR stations that had been built as of June, 2016. A classical set of frequently used metrics based on complex network theory were analyzed, including degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and closeness centrality. The frequency distributions of all three metrics demonstrated highly consistent bimodal-like patterns, suggesting that the Chinese HSR network consists of two distinct regimes. The results indicate that the Chinese HSR system has a hierarchical structure, rather than a scale-free structure as has been commonly observed. To the best of our knowledge, such a network structure has not been found in other railway systems, or in transportation systems in general. Follow-up studies are needed to reveal the formation mechanisms of this hierarchical network structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000458761300028	30759102	J	Wang, Lu; Zheng, Junjun				jam, amir/O-6460-2019				Research on low-carbon diffusion considering the game among enterprises in the complex network context								JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				210				1	11		10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.10.297					FEB 10 2019	2019	Considering the game among enterprises, this paper studies low-carbon diffusion problem from the perspective of network characteristics and consumers' environmental awareness. Under the scenario of heterogeneous environmental awareness, the low-carbon diffusion model based on evolutionary game theory and complex network theory is established to describe the game of enterprises' low-carbon strategy adoption in the network and the strategy learning among network neighbors. Simulation analysis in complex networks reveals the roles of network characteristics such as average degree, degree distribution and consumers' environmental awareness played in low-carbon diffusion. The results show that increasing the connections among enterprises in the industry can help the spread of low-carbon strategies. However, the diffusion potential of the network is largely exploited when the average degree exceeds 6, and the low-carbon strategies spread slowly afterwards. A certain percentage of green consumers drives this certain percentage of enterprises to implement low-carbon strategies approximately in equilibrium which indicates that the low-carbon diffusion rate can reach 100% when all consumers become green consumers who are willing and able to pay for low-carbon premium. White customers contribute to the spread of low-carbon strategies, but the promotion effect is not as good as green customers. The small-world (SW) network is more efficiently than the scale-free (SF) network in low-carbon diffusion when consumers' environmental awareness is low. However, when the consumers' environmental awareness is higher than a certain value, the SF network has a higher diffusion rate in equilibrium than the SW network. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Specifically, alliances between manufacturers (as one of the policy initiatives) have been set up to expedite technology diffusion. What are the patterns of technology diffusion in the alliance, and what are the effects of low carbon policy on the diffusion of technology in the alliance? Using game-based theory, this paper builds an evolutionary game model of technology diffusion between enterprises in the context of a complex network. In particular, it simulates the effects of a carbon trading market, environmental taxes, and innovation subsides, on green technology diffusion of manufacturing firms in a BA scale-free network (Barabasi-Albert model) in China. The results show that various levels of policy-implementation (especially the market-based policies) lead to different rates of diffusion. This study provides insights on green diffusion policies and the effectiveness of their implementation in inter-firm alliances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, instruments for their analysis did not evolve at the same speed. Indeed, interesting information about users' habits and tastes can be recovered just considering the bipartite network of users and products, in which links represent products' purchases and have different weights due to the score assigned to the item in users' reviews. With respect to other weighted bipartite networks, in these systems we observe a maximum possible weight per link, that limits the variability of the outcomes. In the present article we propose an entropy-based randomization method for this type of networks (i.e., bipartite rating networks) by extending the configuration model framework: the randomized network satisfies the constraints of the degree per rating, i.e., the number of given ratings received by the specified product or assigned by the single user. We first show that such a null model is able to reproduce several nontrivial features of the real network better than other null models. Then, using our model as benchmark, we project the information contained in the real system on one of the layers: To provide an interpretation of the projection obtained, we run the Louvain community detection on the obtained network and discuss the observed division in clusters. We are able to detect groups of music albums due to the consumers' taste or communities of movies due to their audience. Finally, we show that our method is also able to handle the special case of categorical bipartite networks: we consider the bipartite categorical network of scientific journals recognized for the scientific qualification in economics and statistics. In the end, from the outcome of our method, the probability that each user appreciate every product can be easily recovered. Therefore, this information may be employed in future applications to implement a more detailed recommendation system that also takes into account information regarding the topology of the observed network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000458140700004	30934284	J	Xu, Zhongpu; Li, Kezan; Sun, Mengfeng; Fu, Xinchu				Fu, Xinchu/G-5995-2010	Fu, Xinchu/0000-0003-4936-0384			Interaction between epidemic spread and collective behavior in scale-free networks with community structure								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				462				122	133		10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.11.003					FEB 7 2019	2019	Many real-world networks exhibit community structure: the connections within each community are dense, while connections between communities are sparser. Moreover, there is a common but non negligible phenomenon, collective behaviors, during the outbreak of epidemics, are induced by the emergence of epidemics and in turn influence the process of epidemic spread. In this paper, we explore the interaction between epidemic spread and collective behavior in scale-free networks with community structure, by constructing a mathematical model that embeds community structure, behavioral evolution and epidemic transmission. In view of the differences among individuals' responses in different communities to epidemics, we use nonidentical functions to describe the inherent dynamics of individuals. In practice, with the progress of epidemics, individual behaviors in different communities may tend to cluster synchronization, which is indicated by the analysis of our model. By using comparison principle and Geffgorin theorem, we investigate the epidemic threshold of the model. By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, we present the stability analysis of behavioral evolution and epidemic dynamics. Some numerical simulations are performed to illustrate and complement our theoretical results. It is expected that our work can deepen the understanding of interaction between cluster synchronization and epidemic dynamics in scale-free community networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

By reviewing and synthesizing the theoretical literature in this article, we seek to establish a pragmatic analytical framework to capture the underlying functioning of local interactions. It then aims to produce findings on seven distinct marketing campaigns in which the real-world virtual communities offer intact time-series connections. In our considered cases, the firm-to-consumer interactivity plays a pivotal role in social media marketing while the customer-driven influence advances individual information transmission. The significant positive relationships demonstrate features of interactivity within subgroups including reciprocal edges and directed 3-cliques associated with the evolution of the virtual community by electronic word-of-mouth (WOM) of both firm-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer interactions. More importantly, the attenuation of local interactions to a large extent leads to the cut-off point of the growth of the dynamic social network.									2	0	0	0	0	2			1751-7575	1751-7583		WOS:000454124400005		J	Zhao, Tao; Schranz, M.

We have used our network-based phylogenomic synteny analysis pipeline to first analyze the overall patterns and major differences between 87 mammalian and 107 angiosperm genomes. These two important groups have both evolved and radiated over the last similar to 170 MYR. Secondly, we identified the genomic outliers or "rebel genes" within each clade. We theorize that rebel genes potentially have influenced trait and lineage evolution. Microsynteny networks use genes as nodes and syntenic relationships between genes as edges. Networks were decomposed into clusters using the Infomap algorithm, followed by phylogenomic copy-number profiling of each cluster. The differences in syntenic properties of all annotated gene families, including BUSCO genes, between the two clades are striking: most genes are single copy and syntenic across mammalian genomes, whereas most genes are multicopy and/or have lineage-specific distributions for angiosperms. We propose microsynteny scores as an alternative and complementary metric to BUSCO for assessing genome assemblies. We further found that the rebel genes are different between the two groups: lineage-specific gene transpositions are unusual in mammals, whereas single-copy highly syntenic genes are rare for flowering plants. We illustrate several examples of mammalian transpositions, such as brain-development genes in primates, and syntenic conservation across angiosperms, such as single-copy genes related to photosynthesis. Future experimental work can test if these are indeed rebels with a cause.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0027-8424			WOS:000457731900057	30674676	J	Kim, Louis; Fast, Shannon M.; Markuzon, Natasha								Incorporating media data into a model of infectious disease transmission								PLOS ONE				14	2					e0197646	10.1371/journal.pone.0197646					FEB 4 2019	2019	Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000457744200001	30716139	J	Dong, Zhengcheng; Tian, Meng; Lu, Yuxin; Lai, Jingang; Tang, Ruoli; Li, Xin								Impact of core-periphery structure on cascading failures in interdependent scale-free networks								PHYSICS LETTERS A				383	7			607	616		10.1016/j.physleta.2018.12.042					FEB 4 2019	2019	Core-periphery structure is a typical meso-scale structure in networks. Previous studies on core-periphery structure mainly focus on the improvement of detection methods, while the research on the impact of core-periphery structure on cascading failures in interdependent networks is still missing. Therefore, we investigate the cascading failures of interdependent scale-free networks with different core-periphery structures and coupling preferences in the paper. First, we introduce an evaluation index to calculate the goodness of core-periphery structure. Second, we propose a new scale-free network evolution model, which can generate tunable core-periphery structures, and its degree distribution is analyzed mathematically. Finally, based on a degree-load-based cascading failure model, we mainly investigate the impact of goodness of core-periphery structure on cascading failures in both symmetrical and asymmetrical interdependent networks. Through numerical simulations, we find that with the same average degree, the networks with weak core-periphery structure will be more robust, while the initial load on node will influence the improvement of robustness. In addition, we also find that the inter-similarity coupling performs better than random coupling. These findings may be helpful for building resilient interdependent networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Despite this intention, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which were adopted to implement the agenda, are fragmented in their formulation and largely sectoral. We contend that while the design of the SDG monitoring is based on a systems approach, it still misses most of the dynamics and complexity relevant to sustainability outcomes. We propose that insights from the study of social-ecological systems offer a more integrated approach to the implementation of Agenda 2030, particularly the monitoring of progress towards sustainable development outcomes. Using five key features highlighted by the study of social-ecological systems (SESs) relevant to sustainable development: (1) social-ecological feedbacks, (2) resilience, (3) heterogeneity, (4) nonlinearity, and (5) cross-scale dynamics. We analyze the current set of SDG indicators based on these features to explore current progress in making them operational. Our analysis finds that 59% of the indicators account for heterogeneity, 33% for cross-scale dynamics, 23% for nonlinearities, and 18% and 17%, respectively, for social-ecological feedbacks and resilience. Our findings suggest limited use of complex SES science in the current design of SDG monitoring, but combining our findings with recent studies of methods to operationalize SES features suggests future directions for sustainable development monitoring for the current as well as post 2030 set of indicators.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2071-1050			WOS:000460819100250		J	Liu, Chen; Shi, Juan; Li, Tong; Liu, Jinzhuo								Aspiration driven coevolution resolves social dilemmas in networks								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				342				247	254		10.1016/j.amc.2018.09.034					FEB 1 2019	2019	In realistic world, the role or influence of each individual is heterogeneous and usually varies according to surroundings. Inspired by this fact, here we study the emergence of cooperative behavior in weighted networks under the coevolution of game strategy and node weight, where the node weight is used to mimic the role or influence of subjects. In the prisoner's dilemma, if an individual's fitness exceeds the aspiration level, its weight becomes larger; otherwise weight decreases. While such an adjustment of weight is defined by the intensity parameter delta, it is interesting that there is an optimal range for delta guaranteeing the best evolution of cooperation. The facilitation of cooperative behavior mainly depends on the weight distribution of players, which is based on the formation of a cooperative cluster controlled by high-weight cooperators. These cooperators are able to prevail against defectors even when there is a large temptation to defect. Our research provides a viable route to resolve social dilemma and will inspire further applications.

Modulo reasonable sparsity assumptions, we are then able to show that a strong form of idemetricity is actually equivalent to a very weak expander condition (PUMP). This provides a direct way of providing short proofs that small-world network models such as the Watts-Strogatz model are strongly idemetric (for a wide range of parameters), and also provides further evidence that being idemetric is a common property. We then consider how satisfaction of the idemetric property is relevant to algorithm design. For idemetric graphs, we observe, for example, that a single breadth-first search provides a solution to the all-pairs shortest paths problem, so long as one is prepared to accept paths which are of stretch close to 2 with high probability. Since we are able to show that Kleinberg's model is idemetric, these results contrast nicely with the well known negative results of Kleinberg concerning efficient decentralized algorithms for finding short paths: for precisely the same model as Kleinberg's negative results hold, we are able to show that very efficient (and decentralized) algorithms exist if one allows for reasonable preprocessing. For deterministic distributed routing algorithms we are also able to obtain results proving that less routing information is required for idemetric graphs than in the worst case in order to achieve stretch less than 3 with high probability: while Omega(n(2)) routing information is required in the worst case for stretch strictly less than 3 on almost all pairs, for idemetric graphs the total routing information required is O(n log(n)).									0	0	0	0	0	0			1364-5021	1471-2946		WOS:000465426300001	30853838	J	Wang, Zhibo; Wu, Huaiqin								Global synchronization in fixed time for semi-Markovian switching complex dynamical networks with hybrid couplings and time-varying delays								NONLINEAR DYNAMICS				95	3			2031	2062		10.1007/s11071-018-4675-2					FEB 2019	2019	This paper is concerned with the global synchronization in fixed time for semi-Markovian switching complex dynamical networks with hybrid couplings and time-varying delays in the presence of disturbances. Firstly, the property with respect to the global stability in fixed time is developed for semi-Markovian switching nonlinear systems. Subsequently, a novel sliding manifold with double integration is presented based on the proposed principle of convergence in fixed time. Under the designed sliding mode controller, the state trajectory of synchronization error system is driven to the prescribed sliding manifold in fixed time. In addition, the global stability in fixed time of sliding mode dynamics is proved analytically. By means of the stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, the synchronization condition is established in terms of linear matrix inequalities; moreover, the stochastic fixed settling-time can be determined to any desired values in advance, via the configuration of parameters in the proposed controller. Finally, two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the theoretical results and the feasibility of the proposed approach.									3	0	0	0	0	3			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000462992400019		J	Weskida, Michaf; Michalski, Radoslaw								Finding influentials in social networks using evolutionary algorithm								JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE				31				77	85		10.1016/j.jocs.2018.12.010					FEB 2019	2019	The social influence maximization problem is an important research topic for many years since it has a tremendous impact on society. As social influence can be maximized for many purposes, such as marketing, politics, spreading innovations, there are many stakeholders interested in progress in this area. As it has been shown, for most settings finding an optimal seed set is an NP-hard problem, this is why various heuristics started to emerge since the statement of the problem. In this work, we explore the applicability of evolutionary algorithm for influence maximization. The experiments conducted using real and artificial social networks and the linear threshold influence model show that this approach offers not only speed and accuracy. Also, some other interesting features have been found, such as the transferability of its parameters to other datasets. Summarizing the results, it was observed that the evolutionary algorithm does not lose its performance when limiting its time by the factor of two and for most datasets, we obtained a high correlation of ranked parameters' sets used for the evolutionary algorithm, typically around 0.9. Overall, these features combined make this approach an interesting research direction for influence maximization. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, this relationship is not explicitly known and is usually studied in simulations, often with the simplifying assumption that the contact network is static in time, though human contact networks are dynamic. We simulate pathogen phylogenetic trees on dynamic Erds-Renyi random networks and on two dynamic networks with skewed degree distribution, of which one is additionally clustered. We use tree shape features to explore how adding dynamics changes the relationships between the overall network structure and phylogenies. Our tree features include the number of small substructures (cherries, pitchforks) in the trees, measures of tree imbalance (Sackin index, Colless index), features derived from network science (diameter, closeness), as well as features using the internal branch lengths from the tip to the root. Using principal component analysis we find that the network dynamics influence the shapes of phylogenies, as does the network type. We also compare dynamic and time-integrated static networks. We find, in particular, that static network models like the widely used Barabasi-Albert model can be poor approximations for dynamic networks. We explore the effects of mis-specifying the network on the performance of classifiers trained identify the transmission rate (using supervised learning methods). We find that both mis-specification of the underlying network and its parameters (mean degree, turnover rate) have a strong adverse effect on the ability to estimate the transmission parameter. We illustrate these results by classifying HIV trees with a classifier that we trained on simulated trees from different networks, infection rates and turnover rates. Our results point to the importance of correctly estimating and modelling contact networks with dynamics when using phylodynamic tools to estimate epidemiological parameters.									0	0	0	0	0	0				1553-7358		WOS:000460276500025	30807578	J	Zhao, Xiaohui; Liu, Zhi-Ping				Liu, Zhi-Ping/C-9846-2010	Liu, Zhi-Ping/0000-0001-7742-9161			Analysis of Topological Parameters of Complex Disease Genes Reveals the Importance of Location in a Biomolecular Network								GENES				10	2					143	10.3390/genes10020143					FEB 2019	2019	Network biology and medicine provide unprecedented opportunities and challenges for deciphering disease mechanisms from integrative viewpoints. The disease genes and their products perform their dysfunctions via physical and biochemical interactions in the form of a molecular network. The topological parameters of these disease genes in the interactome are of prominent interest to the understanding of their functionality from a systematic perspective. In this work, we provide a systems biology analysis of the topological features of complex disease genes in an integrated biomolecular network. Firstly, we identify the characteristics of four network parameters in the ten most frequently studied disease genes and identify several specific patterns of their topologies. Then, we confirm our findings in the other disease genes of three complex disorders (i.e., Alzheimer's disease, diabetes mellitus, and hepatocellular carcinoma). The results reveal that the disease genes tend to have a higher betweenness centrality, a smaller average shortest path length, and a smaller clustering coefficient when compared to normal genes, whereas they have no significant degree prominence. The features highlight the importance of gene location in the integrated functional linkages.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2073-4425			WOS:000460742800072	30769902	J	Hyman, J.

The three networks we consider have the same fracture intensity values but exhibit different percolation densities, geometric properties, and topological structures. We considered two different average transport models to predict solute breakthrough, a streamtube model and a Bernoulli continuous time random walk model, both of which provide insights into the flow fields within the networks. The streamtube model provides acceptable predictions at short distances in two of the networks but fails in all cases to predict breakthrough times at the outlet plane, which indicates that particle motion in such fracture networks cannot be characterized by a constant velocity between the inlet and control plane at which the breakthrough curve is detected. Rather, the structure of the network requires that frequent velocity transitions be made as particles move through the system. Despite the relatively broad distribution of fracture radii and relatively small number of independent velocity transitions, the continuous time random walk approach conditioned on the initial velocity distribution provides reasonable predictions for the breakthrough curves at different distances from the inlet. The application of these averaged transport models provides a richer understanding of the link from the fracture network structure to flow and transport properties.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-9313	2169-9356		WOS:000462355800003		J	Mitze, Timo; Strotebeck, Falk								Determining factors of interregional research collaboration in Germany's biotech network: Capacity, proximity, policy?								TECHNOVATION				80-81				40	53		10.1016/j.technovation.2018.11.001					FEB-MAR 2019	2019	This paper analyses the determinants of link formation in Germany's biotech research network. Given the significance of regional clusters in the national biotech landscape, the modeling framework adopts a regional perspective and uses small-scale NUTS3 regions as nodes of the national biotech network. Linkages between nodes are measured by the number of active research collaborations between biotech actors located in these regions. The degree of the interregional collaboration activity between regional nodes is modeled as a function of the regions' research and economic capabilities, the geographical distance between regions, and a set of policy variables. The empirical results from count data regressions show that link formation is significantly related to both node properties and the relationship between nodes. While locational factors such as regional high-tech start-up rates, the endowment with MINT employees and the population density as a broad measure for agglomeration economies are positively correlated with the extent of interregional research collaboration, distance acts an impediment to interregional collaboration. The results further show that the pursuit of network and cluster policies in the biotech sector, particularly through collaborative R&D funding, positively affects the strength of interregional collaboration activities.					29th International-Society-for-Professional-Innovation-Management (ISPIM) Innovation Conference29th International-Society-for-Professional-Innovation-Management (ISPIM) Innovation Conference	JUN 17-20, 2018JUN 17-20, 2018	Int Soc Profess Innovat ManagementInt Soc Profess Innovat Management	Stockholm, SWEDENStockholm, SWEDEN	1	0	0	1	0	1			0166-4972	1879-2383		WOS:000461727800004		J	Wang, Jing; Zhang, Kedi; Sun, Xiaoli; Tan, Yusong; Wu, Qingbo; Wu, Quanyuan								Package Network Model: A Way to Capture Holistic Structural Features of Open-Source Operating Systems								SYMMETRY-BASEL				11	2					172	10.3390/sym11020172					FEB 2019	2019	Open-source software has become a powerful engine for the development of the software industry. Its production mode, which is based on large-scale group collaboration, allows for the rapid and continuous evolution of open-source software on demand. As an important branch of open-source software, open-source operating systems are commonly used in modern service industries such as finance, logistics, education, medical care, e-commerce and tourism, etc. The reliability of these systems is increasingly valued. However, a self-organizing and loosely coupled development approach complicates the structural analysis of open-source operating system software. Traditional methods focus on analysis at the local level. There is a lack of research on the relationship between internal attributes and external overall characteristics. Consequently, conventional methods are difficult to adapt to complex software systems, especially the structural analysis of open-source operating system software. It is therefore of great significance to capture the holistic structure and behavior of the software system. Complex network theory, which is adequate for this task, can make up for the deficiency of traditional software structure evaluation methods that focus only on local structure. In this paper, we propose a package network model, which is a directed graph structure, to describe the dependency of open-source operating system software packages. Based on the Ubuntu Kylin Linux Operating system, we construct a software package dependency network of each distributed version and analyze the structural evolution through the dimensions of scale, density, connectivity, cohesion, and heterogeneity of each network.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-8994			WOS:000460767300050		J	Wang, Zongrun; Chen, Songsheng								Market efficiency, strategies and incomes of heterogeneously informed investors in a social network environment								JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR & ORGANIZATION				158				15	32		10.1016/j.jebo.2018.10.017					FEB 2019	2019	This study introduces a two factor interaction function and a strategy improvement mechanism to construct a heterogeneous information model in a social network environment. Due to the different environmental characteristics of offline and online communication, the Watts Strogatz small world network and the modified Barabasi Albert network were used to simulate real-world offline and online environments, respectively, and a market without social networking is added to facilitate comparison. We conducted the market simulation under three different network environments. With simulated market data, the evolution of the investor's strategy, net income, and market efficiency was analyzed. The results show that after three markets reached equilibrium, the number of insider investors and the information cost is the highest in the online environment and the lowest in the noninteractive environment, while market efficiency shows the converse pattern. With social interaction, private signals purchased by investors are publicized in their social circles. This pattern could result in a herd effect of decision making under a false belief, followed by a decrease in market efficiency and an increase in the insider investor ratio. Investors in an online environment have more neighbors and more interlaced social ties than investors in an offline environment. Thus, the increase in information channels facilitates the transformation of private signals into public ones, which further reduces market efficiency and increases the number of insider investors.

Both methodologies are applied comparatively to coupled IEEE and natural gas test networks. The cascading failure events are simulated through two strategies of network decomposition: Deliberate attacks on highly connected nodes and random faults. The analysis is performed by simulating successive N-k contingencies in a coupled network, where the network structure changes with the elimination of each node. The suitability of graph-theoretic techniques for assessing the vulnerability of interdependent electric power and natural gas infrastructures is demonstrated.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1996-1073			WOS:000460666200089		J	Gunduc, Semra								THE EFFECTS OF DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION ON EPIDEMIC SPREAD - A MULTILAYER APPROACH								ACTA PHYSICA POLONICA B				50	2			179	197		10.5506/APhysPolB.50.179					FEB 2019	2019	In this work, the aim is to study the spread of a contagious disease and information on a multilayer social system. The main idea is to find a criterion under which the adoption of the spreading information blocks or suppresses the epidemic spread. A two-layer network is the base of the model. The first layer describes the direct contact interactions, while the second layer is the information propagation layer. Both layers consist of the same nodes. The society consists of five different categories of individuals: susceptibles, infective, recovered, vaccinated and precautioned. Initially, only one infected individual starts transmitting the infection. Direct contact interactions spread the infection to the susceptibles. The information spreads through the second layer. The SIR model is employed for the infection spread, while the Bass equation models the adoption of information. The control parameters of the competition between the spread of information and spread of disease are the topology and the density of connectivity. The topology of the information layer is a scale-free network with increasing density of edges. In the contact layer, regular and scale-free networks with the same average degree per node are used interchangeably. The observation is that increasing complexity of the contact network reduces the role of individual awareness. If the contact layer consists of networks with limited range connections, or the edges sparser than the information network, spread of information plays a significant role in controlling the epidemics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0587-4254	1509-5770		WOS:000460892000006		J	Liu, Yangyang; Zhao, Chengli; Yi, Dongyun; Stanley, H.

We compare analytically and numerically the robustness of partially interdependent networks with a broad range of parameters including coupling strength, attack strength, and network type. We observe the first and second order phase transition and accurately characterize the critical points for each combined attack. Generally, combined attacks show more efficient damage to interdependent networks. Besides, we find that, when robustness is measured by the critical removing ratio and the critical coupling strength, the conclusion drawn for a combined attack is not always consistent.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-1500	1089-7682		WOS:000460032800001	30823717	J	Piraveenan, Mahendra; Senanayake, Upul; Matous, Petr; Todo, Yasuyuki								Assortativity and mixing patterns in international supply chain networks								CHAOS				29	2					023124	10.1063/1.5082015					FEB 2019	2019	As economic globalisation increases, inclination toward domestic protectionism is also increasing in many countries of the world. To improve the productivity and the resilience of national economies, it is important to understand the drivers and the barriers of the internatiolisation of economic activities. While internatiolisation of individual economic actors is difficult to explain using traditional theories, aggregate patterns may be explained to some extent. We take a network-centric perspective to describe the extent of corporate internatiolisation in different countries. Based on Newman's assortativity coefficient, we design a range of assortativity metrics which are appropriate in the firm network context. Using these, we quantify companies' appetite for internatiolisation in relation to the internatiolisation of their partners. We use the Factset Revere dataset, which is provided by FactSet Research Systems Inc., that captures global supply chain relationships between companies. We identify countries where the level of internationalisation is relatively high or relatively low, and we show that subtle differences in the assortativity metrics used change the ranking of countries significantly in terms of the assortativity correlation, highlighting that companies in different countries are prone to different types of internationalisation. Overall, we demonstrate that firms from most countries in the dataset studied have a slight preference to make supply chain relationships with other firms which have undergone a similar level of internationalisation, and other firms from their own country. The implications of our results are important for countries to understand the evolution of international relationships in their corporate environments, and how they compare to other nations in the world in this regard.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-1500	1089-7682		WOS:000460032800027	30823710	J	Xu, Hedong; Tian, Cunzhi; Fan, Suohai; Li, Jiajia								Information flows in the market: An evolutionary game approach								CHAOS				29	2					023126	10.1063/1.5084070					FEB 2019	2019	Information influences the decisions that investors make in the markets. Whether this information is true or false can be quantified and distinguished by markets. To study how information propagates through markets, we propose an information flow game based on an evolutionary game approach. In reality, investors transmit profits or losses when they transmit information, because there are values associated with information in the market. In the information flow game, information is represented by its value. Investors in the game can choose to be sharers or silencers. Sharers share their information with their neighbors according to a sharing rate alpha, which is a key quantity in the model. In the evolutionary process, we show that more sharers emerge when the market is full of rumors, especially as the sharing rate increases. Higher values of the sharing rate reduce the standard deviation of the information value in such markets, whereas the opposite occurs in markets that largely consist of true information. The reactions of the investors are asymmetric, which indicates that investors are more sensitive to losses than to profits. Furthermore, as the network becomes more random, a higher sharing rate becomes more beneficial for the stability of the emergence of sharers if information is generally false, whereas a lower sharing rate is helpful for the stability of the emergence of sharers if information is generally true.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1054-1500	1089-7682		WOS:000460032800029	30823723	J	Rusek, Krzysztof; Cholda, Piotr								Message-Passing Neural Networks Learn Little's Law								IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS				23	2			274	277		10.1109/LCOMM.2018.2886259					FEB 2019	2019	This letter presents a solution to the problem of universal representation of graphs exemplifying communication network topologies with the help of neural networks.

CNs are blooming, they range from small ones (tens of nodes) to gigantic ones (tens of thousands of nodes). They are made primarily of wireless links but in some cases, they mix wired and wireless technologies. CNs are generally unplanned and nonlayered, and the community tries to mirror the same approach in its governance, avoiding unnecessary management structures and relying on self-organization and spontaneous interactions. CNs are peer production platforms, a community of people that pools resources and contributes to build a shared value. While this value is generally immaterial (as in WikiPedia) CNs instead realize a distributed, peer-to-peer physical communication network. This paper analyses ninux.org, the largest CN in Italy, and one of the eldest in Europe. The goal of this paper is to understand if the spontaneous growth of the network and the community leads to a technically robust network and a socially robust community, or it hides the presence of (potentially interdependent) points of failure. We will show that, in spite of the original motivations of the ninux community, the network is fragile under several aspects, and we suggest ways to improve it.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2329-924X			WOS:000458813600009		J	Wang, Shuangyan; Cuomo, Salvatore; Mei, Gang; Cheng, Wuyi; Xu, Nengxiong				Cuomo, Salvatore/Q-1365-2016; Mei, Gang/C-9124-2016	Cuomo, Salvatore/0000-0003-4128-2588; Mei, Gang/0000-0003-0026-5423			Efficient method for identifying influential vertices in dynamic networks using the strategy of local detection and updating								FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				91				10	24		10.1016/j.future.2018.08.047					FEB 2019	2019	The identification of influential vertices in complex networks can facilitate understanding and prediction of the behaviour of real systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for identifying influential vertices in dynamic networks by exploiting the strategy of local detection and updating. The essential strategy of the proposed local detection and updating method is to locally detect the altered vertices in dynamic networks and locally update the influence metrics of the altered vertices, without the need to globally calculate the influence of all vertices. To evaluate the computational efficiency of the proposed local detection and updating method, we design 15 groups of experimental tests for three types of complex networks (the Barabasi-Albert (BA) scale-free network, the Watts-Strogatz (WS) small-world network, and the Erdo s-Renyi (ER) random network). Experimental results demonstrate that: (1) the sequential version of the proposed method is approximately 3 times faster than the global calculation method for the small-world networks and random networks; (2) the parallel version of the proposed method, which was developed on a multi-core CPU, is approximately 10 times faster than the global calculation method for the scale-free networks. The proposed local detection and updating method can be employed to efficiently identify the influential vertices and predict the changes in influence of specified sets of vertices in dynamic networks.

However, how to theoretically model such networks, along with quantitive characterizations, remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we develop a novel evolving model, which, as validated by our empirical results, can well capture some basic properties such as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter, and community structure embodied in most real datasets. Particularly, two types of results are presented in this paper. First, our proposed model, namely, evolving K-Graph, consists of K-node sets representing K different types of entities. The hybrid interactions among entities, based on whether they belong to the same type, are classified into inter-type and intra-type ones that are, respectively, characterized by two joint graphs evolving over time. Following our newly proposed mechanism called interactive-evolution, potential connections can be established among nodes with common features and further form a positive feedback. The superiorities of our model are three folded: good capture of realistic networks, mathematical tractability, and efficient implementation. Second, by analytical derivations, along with empirical validation on real datasets, we disclose two aspects of network properties: basic ones as power-law degree distribution, densification, shrinking diameter and community structure, as well as a distinctive one, that is, positive correlation observed in real networks, implying that a hub in one inter-type relationship network also has many neighbors in another one. An additional interesting finding is that through further comparison of models with or without interactive-evolution, the former one leads to an even earlier occurrence of network connectivity.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000458851600010		J	Skibski, Oskar; Rahwan, Talal; Michalak, Tomasz P.; Wooldridge, Michael					Skibski, Oskar/0000-0002-3978-416X			Enumerating Connected Subgraphs and Computing the Myerson and Shapley Values in Graph-Restricted Games								ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY				10	2					15	10.1145/3235026					FEB 2019	2019	At the heart of multi-agent systems is the ability to cooperate to improve the performance of individual agents and/or the system as a whole. While a widespread assumption in the literature is that such cooperation is essentially unrestricted, in many realistic settings this assumption does not hold. A highly influential approach for modelling such scenarios are graph-restricted games introduced by Myerson [36]. In this approach, agents are represented by nodes in a graph, edges represent communication channels, and a group can generate an arbitrary value only if there exists a direct or indirect communication channel between every pair of agents within the group. Two fundamental solution-concepts that were proposed for such games are the Myerson value and the Shapley value. While an algorithm has been developed to compute the Shapley value in arbitrary graph-restricted games, no such general-purpose algorithm has been developed for the Myerson value to date. With this in mind, we set out to develop for such games a general-purpose algorithm to compute the Myerson value, and a more efficient algorithm to compute the Shapley value. Since the computation of either value involves enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of the game's underlying graph, we start by developing an algorithm dedicated to this enumeration, and then we show empirically that it is faster than the state of the art in the literature. Finally, we present a sample application of both algorithms, in which we test the Myerson value and the Shapley value as advanced measures of node centrality in networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2157-6904	2157-6912		WOS:000459804500004		J	Tu, Jing								What connections lead to good scientific performance?

More intensive connections are found between top institutions, and most institutions are connected into the largest component. The effect of international connection on performance is compared between US and non-US institutions. The homophily of centrality, tie strength and h-index measured as assortativity coefficient is described to show how institutions of similar properties tend to connect with each other in the graph. Furtherly, a negative binomial regression model is employed to investigate the relationship between the homogenous connections and the citation counts received by the connections. Characteristics of connections that contribute to good performance are then obtained.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0138-9130	1588-2861		WOS:000458190700010		J	Bose, S. K.; Shirai, S.; Mallinson, J.

We show that variation of the strength and duration of the electric field applied to this network of synapse-like atomic switches allows us to control the switching dynamics. Switching is observed for voltages above a well-defined threshold, with higher voltages leading to increased switching rates. We demonstrate two behavioral archetypes and show how the switching dynamics change as a function of duration and amplitude of the voltage stimulus. We show that the state of each synapse can influence the activity of the other synapses, leading to complex switching dynamics. We further demonstrate the influence of the morphology of the network on the measured device properties, and the constraints imposed by the overall network conductance. The correlated switching dynamics, device stability over long periods, and the simplicity of the device fabrication provide an attractive pathway to practical implementation of on-chip neuromorphic computing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1359-6640	1364-5498		WOS:000459184500027	30357187	J	Tan, Dapeng; Zhang, Libin; Ai, Qinglin								An embedded self-adapting network service framework for networked manufacturing system								JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT MANUFACTURING				30	2			539	556		10.1007/s10845-016-1265-3					FEB 2019	2019	To improve the self-adapting ability and real-time performance of client/server based networked manufacturing system (NMS), this paper introduces the universal plug and play (UPnP), an intelligent network middleware, into networked manufacturing area, and proposes an embedded self-adapting network framework and related service methods.

Then, the self-adapting services for NMS are performed by UPnP service-calling and inter-process communication methods. Finally, the case studies and industrial field experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed service framework.									15	2	0	2	0	15			0956-5515	1572-8145		WOS:000459074200005		J	Gao, Zi-lin; Wang, Yin-he; Xiong, Jiang; Zhang, Li-li; Wang, Wen-li								Robust State Observer Design for Dynamic Connection Relationships in Complex Dynamical Networks								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL AUTOMATION AND SYSTEMS				17	2			336	344		10.1007/s12555-018-0315-3					FEB 2019	2019	The complex dynamical network with the time-varying links may be regarded to be composed of the two mutually coupled subsystems, which are called the nodes subsystem and the connection relationships subsystem respectively. Designing the state observer for the nodes subsystem has been discussed in some existing researches by employing the known connection relationships. However, the state observer design for the connection relationships subsystem is not shown in the existing researches. In practical applications, the connection relationships subsystem possesses also the state variables such as the relationship strength in social network, the size of web tension in the web winding system. Therefore, designing the state observer for the connection relationships subsystem is also of practical significance. In this paper, a novel state observer is proposed for the connection relationships subsystem modeled mathematically by the Riccati matrix differential equation. The observer utilizes the output measurements of the connection relationships subsystem and the state of nodes subsystem. Compared with the state observer of nodes subsystems which employs the known connection relationships, the state observer for the connection relationships subsystem employs the state of nodes subsystem and is represented in form of the matrix differential equation. By using Lyapunov stability theory, it is proved in this paper that the state observer for the connection relationships subsystem is asymptotical under certain mathematic conditions. Finally, the illustrative simulation is given to show the efficiency and validity of the proposed method in this paper.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1598-6446	2005-4092		WOS:000459038200007		J	Steinbacher, Matjaz; Steinbacher, Mitja					Steinbacher, Matjaz/0000-0003-4521-8890; Steinbacher, Mitja/0000-0003-1865-6262			Opinion Formation with Imperfect Agents as an Evolutionary Process								COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				53	2			479	505		10.1007/s10614-017-9751-z					FEB 2019	2019	We develop and simulate an interaction-based model of continuous opinion formation under bounded confidence to identify conditions and understand circumstances that lead a society into either a consensus, multiple opinion classes or perpetual opinion dynamics. The society is modeled as a social network and random meetings are presumed. When only regular agents are present, we have shown that the small world networks may bring the society very close to consensus for even small threshold levels, but require higher tolerance than the complete network to reach consensus. We have identified the conditions under which the process with stubborn agents generates long-run consensus, permanent disagreement or permanent fluctuation in opinions. There cannot be a persistent fluctuation in opinions in the environment of regular agents nor in the presence of a single group of stubborn agents. In the runs with a single group of stubborn extremists, we have identified the Popper paradox despite the existence of a tolerance span in which the proportion of extremism decreases as the tolerance level increases. Further, in a highly tolerant society with two competing extremist groups, they have no supporters among the regular agents whose opinions are oscillating around the center of the opinion space. The influence of inconsistent agents is persistent and induces a perpetual opinion dynamics. The model is non-equilibrium and emerging, while consensus, if attainable, can be reached in a finite time.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7099	1572-9974		WOS:000458498000001		J	Zhou, Yaoming; Wang, Junwei; Huang, George Q.

This metric is further used to assess and compare the weighted efficiency and robustness of eight domestic ATNs, with the data of routes being operated by all the airlines. Furthermore, the critical airports in these ATNs are identified. It is found that the link weight has a significant impact on the assessment of efficiency and robustness and ranking of critical airports.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1366-5545			WOS:000458593800002		J	Vega, Carlos J.; Suarez, Oscar J.; Sanchez, Edgar N.; Chen, Guanrong; Elvira-Ceja, Santiago; Rodriguez-Castellanos, David					Suarez, Oscar J./0000-0002-6754-5713; Vega, Carlos J./0000-0002-8941-8037			Trajectory Tracking on Complex Networks Via Inverse Optimal Pinning Control								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL				64	2			767	774		10.1109/TAC.2018.2835412					FEB 2019	2019	In this technical note, a novel approach to trajectory tracking control of a complex network is presented, based on the idea and technique of inverse optimal pinning control.

As a result, scholars commonly interpret turnover as the consequence of social networks. Based on conservation of resources theory, we propose an alternative coevolution perspective that recognizes the influence of changes in individuals' social network position on their thoughts of quitting (the consideration of turnover), and which also posits that thoughts of quitting shape individuals' agency in maintaining and changing their social network. Extending previous research, we predict that creation (dissolution) of both friendship ties and advice ties are negatively (positively) related to subsequent thoughts of quitting. We then develop and test the novel hypotheses that for friendship ties, thoughts of quitting are positively related to tie retention and negatively related to tie creation (leading to network stasis), whereas for advice ties thoughts of quitting are negatively related to tie retention and positively related to tie creation (leading to network churn). In a longitudinal network analysis that assessed 121 employees across three time points, we find support for our hypotheses that thoughts of quitting affect network changes, but do not find that network changes affect thoughts of quitting.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0001-4273	1948-0989		WOS:000458495500002		J	Naaman, Roi; Cohen, Keren; Louzoun, Yoram								Edge sign prediction based on a combination of network structural topology and sign propagation								JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS				7	1			54	66		10.1093/comnet/cny012					FEB 2019	2019	The prediction of edge signs in social and biological networks is a major goal of graph-based machine learning and has important implication in recommendation systems. Most current edge sign prediction methods rely on information propagation from neighbouring edges either directly by assuming sign similarity in neighbouring edges or using more complex theories based on combination of edge signs in neighbours. Such methods rely on a high network sampling fraction, and fail at low sampling level. We, here, show that edges with similar network topology, as defined by a combination of network measures have similar signs. The surprising correlation between network topology and edge sign can be used for prediction. Indeed, machine learning algorithm based on this topology can produce a higher accuracy than state of the art methods in standard datasets, even when a very small fraction of the edge signs are known, with an accuracy of up to 93%. We further show that different datasets differ in the importance of different features. A combination of features is always required to obtain a high area under the curve. When the vertices represent people, the sign is mainly affected by the edge target. When the network represents opinions, the signs are mainly affected by the edge source. The proposed method can be applied to directed and undirected, weighted and unweighted networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000458284700002		J	Markovic, Rene; Gosak, Marko; Perc, Matjaz; Marhl, Marko; Grubelnik, Vladimir				Perc, Matjaz/A-5148-2009; Markovic, Rene/M-3148-2019	Perc, Matjaz/0000-0002-3087-541X; Markovic, Rene/0000-0001-9068-6373			Applying network theory to fables: complexity in Slovene belles-lettres for different age groups								JOURNAL OF COMPLEX NETWORKS				7	1			114	127		10.1093/comnet/cny018					FEB 2019	2019	Words are the building blocks of human communication. They are arranged in sentences in a non-trivial and universal way, which implies the existence of fundamental organizational principles that have shaped language development. One of the fundamental examples is the Zipf's law, which says that the frequency of word occurrence is roughly an inverse power-law function of its rank. In our article, we study the structure and complexity of texts in Slovene belles-lettres, with an emphasis on evaluating the differences in the texts for different age groups. We show that the co-occurrence connectivity of words forms a complex and heterogeneous network that is characterized by an efficient transfer of information. Moreover, we show that with the increasing age of readers, the length of texts, the average length of words, different combinations of phrases and the complexity of social interactions between literary characters, also all increase. Conversely, the fraction of unique words decreases. We also show that the word co-occurrence networks for older age groups are less modular and exhibit a higher level of small-worldness, and that the Zipf's exponent as a measure for the linguistic complexity is more negative, than for younger age groups. Taken together, we demonstrate that network theory enables an in-depth theoretical exploration of Slovene belles-lettres, with clear distinctions in statistical properties between different age groups, thus bridging art and exact sciences in a mutually rewarding way.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2051-1310	2051-1329		WOS:000458284700006		J	Nguyen, Win P.

Due to the high interconnectedness and complex interactions within and between CPSs, disruptions are not isolated events, and can propagate with severe impacts both locally and remotely, and must be contained lest catastrophic and irreversible damages occur. Responding agents are often employed to tackle the disruptions, and the agents' effectiveness becomes a critical concern, which is addressed in this article. Although the phenomenon of disruption propagation in CPSs and complex networks is becoming better understood, the interactions between the responding agents and the disruption propagation have not yet been investigated and studied in detail. In this work, the Collaborative Response of Disruption Propagation (CRDP) model is introduced as a general approach to the network disruption propagation problem. The CRDP model captures the important components of the problem: The client network, the agent network, the disruptions, and their interactions. Three system awareness analytics and two novel online scheduling protocols have been developed based on the analysis of the interactions. The analytics and protocols seek to provide insights into the system's conditions, and guide the response agents and their management to contain and eliminate the disruption propagation. The CRDP model, together with its developed analytics and protocols, can be applied to different network types, different disruption scenarios, and different response mechanisms available due to the generality of the model.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0167-9236	1873-5797		WOS:000457506800001		J	Zan, Hao; Zhou, Weixing; Xiao, Xuefeng; Lin, Long; Zhang, Junlong; Li, Haowei								Recurrence network analysis for uncovering dynamic transition of thermo-acoustic instability of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel flow								AEROSPACE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				85				1	12		10.1016/j.ast.2018.11.040					FEB 2019	2019	Characterizing the transition of thermo-acoustic instability of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel flow is a fundamental problem eliciting a great deal of attention from different disciplines. We experimentally and theoretically investigate the transition process between thermo-acoustic stability and instability. The method of recurrence network is applied to analyze the pressure time series of supercritical hydrocarbon fuel flow. As a result, we can distinguish a thermo-acoustic transition process from normal signals by real-time detecting the complexity variation of pressure signals of fuel in cooling channels with the recurrence network method. Then, we construct the recurrence network from experimental data under the stable, transition and unstable states, and investigate the degree distribution and motifs distribution. We find that the degree distribution and motifs distribution allow quantitatively uncovering the complexity dynamic process. We investigate the during time of transition process, and find that the mass flow rate and the inlet pressure will make an influence on the transition time. These findings present a first step towards an improved understanding on the transition of thermo-acoustic instability from a complex network perspective. Moreover, the investigation on the transition of thermo-acoustic instability under supercritical pressure condition offers guidance on the control of scramjet fuel supply, which can secure stable fuel flowing in regenerative cooling system.

Firstly, a more general complex network model is considered, which involves the time-varying delay, IT2 fuzzy and stochastic effects. More specifically, IT2 fuzzy model, as a meaningful fuzzy scheme, is investigated for the first time in CDNs. Then, with the aid of Lyapunov stability theory and stochastic analysis technique, some new sufficient criteria are established to ensure synchronization of the addressed systems. Moreover, on basis of the parallel-distributed compensation (PDC) scheme, two effective fuzzy pinning control protocols are proposed to achieve the synchronization. Finally, a numerical example is performed to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the derived theoretical results.

As the resource description language of the Semantic Web, vagueness RDF data are playing an increasingly important role. And efficient querying of fuzzy RDF data is therefore of increasing importance. In this paper, we firstly introduce practical extensions of the RDF model to represent vagueness based on the fuzzy graph. Then we study the problem of querying subgraph from fuzzy ROE graph that matches with a given pattern graph with high satisfaction degree. The graph pattern surpasses previous proposals in terms of expressiveness because it can use regular expressions to specify the structural conditions of the graph in addition to the fuzzy conditions on the vertex values. We further develop an algorithm for evaluating graph pattern queries based on a revised notion of graph homomorphism. Finally, we verified the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the algorithm using a comprehensive experimental evaluation of real-life data and synthetic data. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We propose a decision support system for analyzing the robustness of supply chain networks against disruptions using topological analysis, performance measurement relevant to a supply chain context, and an optimization for increasing supply network performance. The topology of a supply chain network has considerable implications for its robustness in the presence of disruptions. The system allows decision makers to evaluate topologies of their supply chain networks in a variety of disruption scenarios, thereby proactively managing the supply chain network to understand vulnerabilities of the network before a disruption occurs. Our system calculates performance measurements for a supply chain network in the face of disruptions and provides both topological metrics (through network analysis) and operational metrics (through an optimization model). Through an example application, we evaluate the impact of random and targeted disruptions on the robustness of a supply chain network.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0018-9391	1558-0040		WOS:000456918900011		J	Uzuntarla, Muhammet; Torres, Joaquin J.; Calim, Ali; Barreto, Ernest				Torres, Joaquin J./C-1385-2012; UZUNTARLA, MUHAMMET/G-3719-2010	Torres, Joaquin J./0000-0001-6175-9676; UZUNTARLA, MUHAMMET/0000-0003-4827-4492			Synchronization-induced spike termination in networks of bistable neurons								NEURAL NETWORKS				110				131	140		10.1016/j.neunet.2018.11.007					FEB 2019	2019	We observe and study a self-organized phenomenon whereby the activity in a network of spiking neurons spontaneously terminates. We consider different types of populations, consisting of bistable model neurons connected electrically by gap junctions, or by either excitatory or inhibitory synapses, in a scale-free connection topology. We find that strongly synchronized population spiking events lead to complete cessation of activity in excitatory networks, but not in gap junction or inhibitory networks. We identify the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon by examining the particular shape of the excitatory postsynaptic currents that arise in the neurons. We also examine the effects of the synaptic time constant, coupling strength, and channel noise on the occurrence of the phenomenon. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We have previously shown in mice that volutrauma and atelectrauma act synergistically to cause VILI. We have also postulated that this synergy arises because of a rich-get-richer mechanism in which repetitive lung recruitment generates initial small holes in the blood-gas barrier which are then expanded by over-distension in a manner that favors large holes over small ones. In order to understand the causal link between this process and the derangements in lung mechanics associated with VILI, we developed a mathematical model that incorporates both atelectrauma and volutrauma to predict how the propensity of the lung to derecruit depends on the accumulation of plasma-derived fluid and proteins in the airspaces. We found that the model accurately predicts derecruitment in mice with experimentally induced VILI.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0090-6964	1573-9686		WOS:000456383600024	30421177	J	Sakumoto, Yusuke; Kameyama, Tsukasa; Takano, Chisa; Aida, Masaki								Information Propagation Analysis of Social Network Using the Universality of Random Matrix								IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS				E102B	2			391	399		10.1587/transcom.2018EBP3098					FEB 2019	2019	Spectral graph theory gives an algebraic approach to the analysis of the dynamics of a network by using the matrix that represents the network structure. However, it is not easy for social networks to apply the spectral graph theory because the matrix elements cannot be given exactly to represent the structure of a social network. The matrix element should be set on the basis of the relationship between persons, but the relationship cannot be quantified accurately from obtainable data (e.g., call history and chat history). To get around this problem, we utilize the universality of random matrices with the feature of social networks. As such a random matrix, we use the normalized Laplacian matrix for a network where link weights are randomly given. In this paper, we first clarify that the universality (i.e., the Wigner semicircle law) of the normalized Laplacian matrix appears in the eigenvalue frequency distribution regardless of the link weight distribution. Then, we analyze the information propagation speed by using the spectral graph theory and the universality of the normalized Laplacian matrix. As a result, we show that the worst-case speed of the information propagation changes up to twice if the structure (i.e., relationship among people) of a social network changes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0916-8516	1745-1345		WOS:000457302700026		J	Wang, Lei; Li, Shouwei; Chen, Tingqiang				Chen, Tingqiang/N-4473-2019	Chen, Tingqiang/0000-0002-3013-243X			Investor behavior, information disclosure strategy and counterparty credit risk contagion								CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				119				37	49		10.1016/j.chaos.2018.12.007					FEB 2019	2019	Counterparty credit risk caused by the excessive expansion of credit derivatives is becoming more and more prominent. The study of evolution mechanism of its contagion will help the financial regulators set up a scientific and accessible prevention and control strategy. From the cross perspective of behavioral finance and information economics, this study analyzes the mechanism of counterparty credit risk contagion. Based on the epidemic model, a network model of it is built with the consideration of investor behavior and information disclosure strategy. The network topology characteristics of it are analyzed in theory. Meanwhile, this study analyzes the evolution characteristics of it in numerical simulation. The main conclusions are as follows: First, investor behavior or information disclosure strategy only affects counterparty credit risk contagion in local credit asset network, while it is gradually disappearing in global credit asset network. Second, noise can enhance the impact intensity of investor behavior or information disclosure strategy on counterparty credit risk contagion, and lead to the spread of counterparty credit risk synchronously in local and global credit asset networks. Third, information transmission rate has "local strengthening effect" on investor behavior. The timing of information release and the tendency of information disclosure exert a "global suppression effect" on the influence of investors, and the ability of investor information decision-making has a "local suppression effect" on the timing of information release and the tendency of information disclosure. Through the comprehensive adjustment of investor behavior and information disclosure strategy, the goal of preventing and controlling counterparty credit risk contagion can be realized in local and global credit asset networks.

From the perspective of the box covering, volume dimension, information dimension, and correlation dimension several approaches have been proposed. We modify the commonly used definitions of the box dimension and information dimension to introduce a d-summable approach (a geometric notion that comes from geometric measure theory) of these dimensions. It is applied to calculate d-summable information dimension of several real complex networks. We offer empirical evidence to support the conjecture that d-summable information model worth carrying out than information model for several networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Pinning control is a method that the external control input is added to some agents (pinning nodes), e.g., leaders. By the external control input, consensus to a certain target value (not the average of the initial states) and faster consensus are achieved. In the proposed method, the external control input is calculated by the controller node connected to only pinning nodes. Since the states of all agents are required in calculation of the external control input, communication delays must be considered. The proposed algorithm includes not only calculation of the external control input but also delay compensation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is presented by a numerical example.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1745-1337			WOS:000457302800006		J	Qi, Yi; Zhang, Zhongzhi; Yi, Yuhao; Li, Huan				Zhang, Zhongzhi/G-5522-2011				Consensus in Self-Similar Hierarchical Graphs and Sierpinski Graphs: Convergence Speed, Delay Robustness, and Coherence								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS				49	2			592	603		10.1109/TCYB.2017.2781714					FEB 2019	2019	The hierarchical graphs and Sierpinski graphs are constructed iteratively, which have the same number of vertices and edges at any iteration, but exhibit quite different structural properties: the hierarchical graphs are nonfractal and small-world, while the Sierpinski graphs are fractal and "largeworld." Both graphs have found broad applications. In this paper, we study consensus problems in hierarchical graphs and Sierpinski graphs, focusing on three important quantities of consensus problems, that is, convergence speed, delay robustness, and coherence for first-order (and second-order) dynamics, which are, respectively, determined by algebraic connectivity, maximum eigenvalue, and sum of reciprocal (and square of reciprocal) of each nonzero eigenvalue of Laplacian matrix. For both graphs, based on the explicit recursive relation of eigenvalues at two successive iterations, we evaluate the second smallest eigenvalue, as well as the largest eigenvalue, and obtain the closed-form solutions to the sum of reciprocals (and square of reciprocals) of all nonzero eigenvalues. We also compare our obtained results for consensus problems on both graphs and show that they differ in all quantities concerned, which is due to the marked difference of their topological structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000456733900019	29990290	J	Qiao, Maoying; Yu, Jun; Bian, Wei; Li, Qiang; Tao, Dacheng								Adapting Stochastic Block Models to Power-Law Degree Distributions								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CYBERNETICS				49	2			626	637		10.1109/TCYB.2017.2783325					FEB 2019	2019	Stochastic block models (SBMs) have been playing an important role in modeling clusters or community structures of network data. But, it is incapable of handling several complex features ubiquitously exhibited in real-world networks, one of which is the power-law degree characteristic. To this end, we propose a new variant of SBM, termed power-law degree SBM (PLD-SBM), by introducing degree decay variables to explicitly encode the varying degree distribution over all nodes. With an exponential prior, it is proved that PLD-SBM approximately preserves the scale-free feature in real networks. In addition, from the inference of variational E-Step, PLD-SBM is indeed to correct the bias inherited in SBM with the introduced degree decay factors. Furthermore, experiments conducted on both synthetic networks and two real-world datasets including Adolescent Health Data and the political blogs network verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of cluster prediction accuracies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2168-2267	2168-2275		WOS:000456733900022	29993967	J	Kim, Sang-Yoon; Lim, Woochang								Burst synchronization in a scale-free neuronal network with inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity								COGNITIVE NEURODYNAMICS				13	1			53	73		10.1007/s11571-018-9505-1					FEB 2019	2019	We are concerned about burst synchronization (BS), related to neural information processes in health and disease, in the Barabasi-Albert scale-free network (SFN) composed of inhibitory bursting Hindmarsh-Rose neurons. This inhibitory neuronal population has adaptive dynamic synaptic strengths governed by the inhibitory spike-timing-dependent plasticity (iSTDP). In previous works without considering iSTDP, BS was found to appear in a range of noise intensities for fixed synaptic inhibition strengths. In contrast, in our present work, we take into consideration iSTDP and investigate its effect on BS by varying the noise intensity. Our new main result is to find occurrence of a Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity: good BS gets better via LTD, while bad BS get worse via LTP. This kind of Matthew effect in inhibitory synaptic plasticity is in contrast to that in excitatory synaptic plasticity where good (bad) synchronization gets better (worse) via LTP (LTD). We note that, due to inhibition, the roles of LTD and LTP in inhibitory synaptic plasticity are reversed in comparison with those in excitatory synaptic plasticity. Moreover, emergences of LTD and LTP of synaptic inhibition strengths are intensively investigated via a microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre- and the post-synaptic burst onset times. Finally, in the presence of iSTDP we investigate the effects of network architecture on BS by varying the symmetric attachment degree l and the asymmetry parameter l in the SFN.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1871-4080	1871-4099		WOS:000456184400005	30728871	J	Li, Dan; Schurhoff, Norman								Dealer Networks								JOURNAL OF FINANCE				74	1			91	144		10.1111/jofi.12728					FEB 2019	2019	Dealers in the over-the-counter municipal bond market form trading networks with other dealers to mitigate search frictions. Regulatory data show that this network has a core-periphery structure with 10 to 30 hubs and over 2,000 peripheral broker-dealers in which bonds flow from periphery to core and partially back. Central dealers charge investors up to double the round-trip markups compared to peripheral dealers. In turn, central dealers provide immediacy by matching buyers with sellers more directly and prearranging fewer trades, especially during stress times. Investors thus face a trade-off between execution cost and speed, consistent with network models of decentralized trade.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0022-1082	1540-6261		WOS:000456806700003		J	Pattanayak, Himansu Sekhar; Sangal, Amrit Lal; Verma, Harsh K.								Community detection in social networks based on fire propagation								SWARM AND EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION				44				31	48		10.1016/j.swevo.2018.11.006					FEB 2019	2019	Community detection is one of the key problem areas in social network analysis. It is classified as an NP-hard problem. Although a lot of good approximate algorithms are available for finding clusters in social networks, all those algorithms have serious drawbacks. They have high time complexities and are inefficient in finding shared communities, a phenomenon common in real-world social networks.In this work a novel community detection algorithm is proposed, that is inspired by the fire propagation model, and is named as Fire Spread community detection algorithm (FSA). When a place catches fire, its nearby places are also at risk of getting burned by it. Getting burned by fire depends on several factors, such as distance from the source of fire, the combustive threshold of the material, number of neighbors already in burning state and heat transmission property of the gap between source and current place. Finding a community near a seed node resembles the phenomena of fire propagation originating from a source. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by comparing the modularity and conductance scores with some of the state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for which synthetic and real-world networks are used.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2210-6502	2210-6510		WOS:000456761600003		J	Shi, Yongren; Cameron, Christopher J.; Heckathorn, Douglas D.								Model-Based and Design-Based Inference: Reducing Bias Due to Differential Recruitment in Respondent-Driven Sampling								SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH				48	1			3	33		10.1177/0049124116672682					FEB 2019	2019	Respondent-driven sampling (RDS), a link-tracing sampling and inference method for studying hard-to-reach populations, has been shown to produce asymptotically unbiased population estimates when its assumptions are satisfied. However, some of the assumptions are prohibitively difficult to reach in the field, and the violation of a crucial assumption can produce biased estimates. We compare two different inference approaches: design-based inference, which relies on the known probability of selection in sampling, and model-based inference, which is based on models of human recruitment behavior and the social context within which sampling is conducted. The advantage of the latter approach is that when the violation of an assumption has been shown to produce biased population estimates, the model can be adjusted to more accurately reflect actual recruitment behavior, and thereby control for the source of bias. To illustrate this process, we focus on three sources of bias, differential effectiveness of recruitment, a form of nonresponse bias, and bias resulting from status differentials that produce asymmetries in recruitment behavior. We first present diagnostics for identifying types of bias and then present new forms of a model-based RDS estimator that controls for each type of bias. In this way, we show the unique advantages of a model-based estimator.									4	0	0	1	0	4			0049-1241	1552-8294		WOS:000456415400001		J	Pereda, Maria; Estrada, Ernesto				Pereda, Maria/K-1865-2014	Pereda, Maria/0000-0002-6151-1176			Visualization and machine learning analysis of complex networks in hyperspherical space								PATTERN RECOGNITION				86				320	331		10.1016/j.patcog.2018.09.018					FEB 2019	2019	A complex network is a condensed representation of the relational topological framework of a complex system. A main reason for the existence of such networks is the transmission of items through the entities of these complex systems. Here, we consider a communicability function that accounts for the routes through which items flow on networks. Such a function induces a natural embedding of a network in a Euclidean high-dimensional sphere. We use one of the geometric parameters of this embedding, namely the angle between the position vectors of the nodes in the hyperspheres, to extract structural information from networks. First we propose a simple method for visualizing networks by reducing the dimensionality of the communicability space to 3-dimensional spheres. Secondly, we use clustering analysis to cluster the nodes of the networks based on their similarities in terms of their capacity to successfully deliver information through the network. After testing these approaches in benchmark networks and compare them with the most used clustering methods in networks we analyze two real-world examples. In the first, consisting of a citation network, we discover citation groups that reflect the level of mathematics used in their publications. In the second, we discover groups of genes that coparticipate in human diseases, reporting a few genes that coparticipate in cancer and other diseases. Both examples emphasize the potential of the current methodology for the discovery of new patterns in relational data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

RESEARCH POLICY				48	1			149	168		10.1016/j.respol.2018.08.005					FEB 2019	2019	International research collaboration (IRC) has been increasingly important as an emerging area of innovation studies. This study reviews the intellectual base, main research trajectories and intellectual communities of the IRC research domain over the period 1957-2015. It integrates qualitative review and three quantitative analyses including co-citation network analysis, main path analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis. The results show that the IRC research has gone through three phases, namely, "emergence" (1957-1991), "fermentation" (1992-2005) and "take-off" (2006-2015) phases. The co-citation network analysis confirms that the IRC research field has been developed under the influence of two pioneering studies related to bibliometrics research. The main research trajectories in IRC studies over the three development phases and over the whole period are identified based on the main path analysis, which shows that co-authorship analysis is the main research method in IRC studies. A bibliographic coupling analysis suggests that the whole IRC research domain can be classified into five distinct intellectual areas: drivers of IRC, IRC patterns, IRC effects, IRC networks and IRC measurement. Seven topics for future research are also identified.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0048-7333	1873-7625		WOS:000454466400012		J	Zhang, Weitong; Zhang, Rui; Shang, Ronghua; Li, Juanfei; Jiao, Licheng								Application of natural computation inspired method in community detection								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				515				130	150		10.1016/j.physa.2018.09.186					FEB 1 2019	2019	The study of community structure in complex networks has always been a subject of great concern in various fields. Community structure can reflect the dynamic characteristics and functions of complex networks. In recent years, there has been numerous methods proposed for community detection. Natural computing methods are inspired by nature Which have the ability of self-adaptation, self-organization and self-learning. This kind of methods can solve the complex problem that traditional calculation method cannot solve. With the effective network partition evaluation function proposed, the community detection problem can also be regarded as a kind of optimization problem. Therefore, natural computing methods are widely applied in community detection. This paper summarizes the application of natural computing inspired method in community detection, and briefly introduces its basic framework and development course. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Usually, rational individuals make vaccinating decisions by strategically evaluating the cost of vaccination and the risk of infection. While in reality, individuals' decisions can also be influenced by their social acquaintances. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning-based mechanism to characterize human decision-making process with bounded rationality, which takes into consideration both individuals' rational decisions and social influence from their neighbors. Specifically, we investigate human voluntary vaccinating behaviors in the face of flu-like seasonal diseases in locally-mixed social networks, where each individual together with his/her neighbors forms a well-mixed environment. Through carrying out simulations, we evaluate the performance of decision-making mechanisms with/without reinforcement learning in terms of vaccine coverage, final epidemic size, average payoff and vaccine effectiveness under different settings of relative cost of vaccination and infection. Simulation results show that reinforcement learning can improve the vaccine effectiveness through balancing individuals' rationality and social influence. This emphasizes the importance of appropriately utilizing human bounded rationality in preventing disease epidemics through voluntary vaccination policies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

By incorporating and integrating concepts such as complexity, coding, topological projections and network dynamics, the proposed network-based framework paves the way not only to extending traditional information science, but also to modeling, characterizing and analyzing a broad class of real-world problems, from language communication to DNA coding. Basically, an original network is supposed to be transmitted, with or without compaction, through a sequence of symbols or time-series obtained by sampling its topology by some network dynamics, such as random walks. We show that the degree of compression is ultimately related to the ability to predict the frequency of symbols based on the topology of the original network and the adopted dynamics. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated with respect to the efficiency of transmitting several types of topologies by using a variety of random walks. Several interesting results are obtained, including the behavior of the Barabasi Albert model oscillating between high and low performance depending on the considered dynamics, and the distinct performances obtained for two geographical models.

We assume initial data that is zero everywhere except at a single node. For the case of the homogeneous tree, the solution will either form a traveling front or converge pointwise to zero. This dichotomy is determined by the linear spreading speed and we compute critical values of the diffusion parameter for which the spreading speed is zero and maximal and prove that the system is linearly determined. We also study the growth of the total population in the network and identify the exponential growth rate as a function of the diffusion coefficient, a. Finally, we make predictions for the Fisher-KPP equation on Erdos-Renyi random graphs based upon the results on the homogeneous tree. When a is small we observe via numerical simulations that mean arrival times are linearly related to distance from the initial node and the speed of invasion is well approximated by the linear spreading speed on the tree. Furthermore, we observe that exponential growth rates of the total population on the random network can be bounded by growth rates on the homogeneous tree and provide an explanation for the sub-linear exponential growth rates that occur for small diffusion.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1531-3492	1553-524X		WOS:000449874700014		J	Zheng, Mingwen; Li, Lixiang; Peng, Haipeng; Xiao, Jinghua; Yang, Yixian; Zhang, Yanping; Zhao, Hui				jinghua, xiao/F-3710-2012; Zheng, Mingwen/P-9769-2018	Zheng, Mingwen/0000-0002-0948-7535			General decay synchronization of complex multi-links time-varying dynamic network								COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION				67				108	123		10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.06.015					FEB 2019	2019	In this paper, we discuss the decay synchronization of complex multi-links time-varying dynamic networks (CMTDNs) for the first time. The exponential synchronization, polynomial synchronization and logarithmic synchronization can be seen as the special cases of the decay synchronization. CMTDNs are more general and realistic than the complex network with the single-link. By virtue of the definitions of the psi-type function and psi-type stability, we give the definition of the decay synchronization of the drive-response CMTDNs. Some novel and easily validated sufficient conditions are deduced to ensure the decay synchronization of drive-response CMTDNs based on the Lyapunov stability theory with the help of a novel nonlinear feedback controller and a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii function. Finally, two numerical simulations have been given to verify the correctness of main results. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Here we show that time delay in one layer of the multiplex network governs the transition to synchronization and ES in the other layers. We found that a single layer with time-delayed intra-layer coupling may experience a different type of transition to synchronization, e.g. ES or continuous, depending on the values of time delay. Importantly, the same type of transition is incorporated simultaneously in other layer(s) as well, irrespective of the intra-layer delay values. Hence, a suitable choice of time-delay in only one layer of a multiplex network can lead to a desired (either ES or continuous) transition simultaneously in the other layers, either directly or remotely connected to the delayed layer. These results offer a platform for a better understanding of the dynamics of those complex systems which are represented by the multilayered framework and contain time delays in the communication processes.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1367-2630			WOS:000457286400001		J	Masuda, Naoki; Holme, Petter								Detecting sequences of system states in temporal networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						795	10.1038/s41598-018-37534-2					JAN 28 2019	2019	Many time-evolving systems in nature, society and technology leave traces of the interactions within them. These interactions form temporal networks that reflect the states of the systems. In this work, we pursue a coarse-grained description of these systems by proposing a method to assign discrete states to the systems and inferring the sequence of such states from the data. Such states could, for example, correspond to a mental state (as inferred from neuroimaging data) or the operational state of an organization (as inferred by interpersonal communication). Our method combines a graph distance measure and hierarchical clustering. Using several empirical data sets of social temporal networks, we show that our method is capable of inferring the system's states such as distinct activities in a school and a weekday state as opposed to a weekend state. We expect the methods to be equally useful in other settings such as temporally varying protein interactions, ecological interspecific interactions, functional connectivity in the brain and adaptive social networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000456826200024	30692579	J	Agaoglu, Sukriye Nihal; Calim, Ali; Hoevel, Philipp; Ozer, Mahmut; Uzuntarla, Muhammet				; UZUNTARLA, MUHAMMET/G-3719-2010	Hoevel, Philipp/0000-0002-1370-4272; UZUNTARLA, MUHAMMET/0000-0003-4827-4492			Vibrational resonance in a scale-free network with different coupling schemes								NEUROCOMPUTING				325				59	66		10.1016/j.neucom.2018.09.070					JAN 24 2019	2019	We investigate the phenomenon of vibrational resonance (VR) in neural populations, whereby weak low-frequency signals below the excitability threshold can be detected with the help of additional high-frequency driving. The considered dynamical elements consist of excitable FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons connected by electrical gap junctions and chemical synapses. The VR performance of these populations is studied in unweighted and weighted scale-free networks. We find that although the characteristic network features - coupling strength and average degree - do not dramatically affect the signal detection quality in unweighted electrically coupled neural populations, they have a strong influence on the required energy level of the high-frequency driving force. On the other hand, we observe that unweighted chemically coupled populations exhibit the opposite behavior, and the VR performance is significantly affected by these network features whereas the required energy remains on a comparable level. Furthermore, we show that the observed VR performance for unweighted networks can be either enhanced or worsened by degree-dependent coupling weights depending on the amount of heterogeneity.

Yet, little attention has been paid to dispersal's effects on the evolution of cooperative behaviour in structured populations. To address this issue, we propose two new dispersal modes, parent-preferred and offspring-preferred dispersal, incorporate them into the birth-death update rule, and consider the resultant strategy evolution in the prisoner's dilemma on random-regular, small-world, and scale-free networks, respectively. We find that parent-preferred dispersal favours the evolution of cooperation in these different types of population structures, while offspring-preferred dispersal inhibits the evolution of cooperation in homogeneous populations. On scale-free networks when the strength of parent-preferred dispersal is weak, cooperation can be enhanced at intermediate strengths of offspring-preferred dispersal, and cooperators can coexist with defectors at high strengths of offspring-preferred dispersal. Moreover, our theoretical analysis based on the pair-approximation method corroborates the evolutionary outcomes on random-regular networks. We also incorporate the two new dispersal modes into three other update rules (death-birth, imitation, and pairwise comparison updating), and find that similar results about the effects of parent-preferred and offspring-preferred dispersal can again be observed in the aforementioned different types of population structures. Our work, thus, unveils robust effects of preferential dispersal modes on the evolution of cooperation in different interactive environments.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0962-8452	1471-2954		WOS:000465430300001	30963948	J	Lee, Bokwon; Lee, Kyu-Min; Yang, Jae-Suk				Yang, Jae-Suk/F-2332-2015	Yang, Jae-Suk/0000-0001-9595-5229; lee, bokwon/0000-0001-9920-7455			Network structure reveals patterns of legal complexity in human society: The case of the Constitutional legal network								PLOS ONE				14	1					e0209844	10.1371/journal.pone.0209844					JAN 23 2019	2019	Complexity in nature has been broadly found not only in physical and biological systems but also in social and economic systems. Although many studies have examined complex systems and helped us understand real-world complexity, the investigation to the legal complexity has not been thoroughly investigated. Here we introduce a novel approach to studying complex legal systems using complex network approaches. On the basis of the bipartite relations among Constitution articles and Court decisions, we built a complex legal network and found the system shows the heterogeneous structure as generally observed in many complex social systems. By treating legal networks as unique political regimes, we examine whether structural properties of the systems have been influenced as the society changes, or not. On one hand, there is a core structure in all legal networks regardless of any social circumstances. On the other hand, with relative comparison among different regimes' networks, we could identify characteristic structural properties that reveal their identity. Our analysis would contribute to provide a better understanding of legal complexity and practical guidelines for use in various legal and social applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000456442800024	30673731	J	Zou, Yong; Donner, Reik V.; Marwan, Norbert; Donges, Jonathan F.; Kurths, Juergen					Donges, Jonathan/0000-0001-5233-7703; Zou, Yong/0000-0002-3241-3139			Complex network approaches to nonlinear time series analysis								PHYSICS REPORTS-REVIEW SECTION OF PHYSICS LETTERS				787				1	97		10.1016/j.physrep.2018.10.005					JAN 21 2019	2019	In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.

We first reformulate the necessary and sufficient condition for reaching a consensus, then the condition is used to set up the pattern of information transmissions. By classifying the individuals into a sequential series of classes and by giving the dynamic contents of centrality, we demonstrate that the hierarchical centralities with descend strength are associated with the sequential series of classes in information transmissions. The results provide wide applications in social engineering, an example about the merger of different groups is discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Cascading failures are the cause of most large-scale network outages. We study the cascading failure of networks due to overload, using the betweenness centrality of an edge as the measure of its initial load. Taking into account the congestion effect of a slightly overloading edge, we define two capacities (the basic capacity and the removal capacity) of every edge and give three possible states (the free state, the congestion state, and the removal state) of every edge according to its current load. We propose a new method to dynamically adjust two capacities of the slightly overloading edge and study the dynamical features of cascading propagation induced by removing the edge with the highest load in two artificial networks, two traffic networks, and two power grids. We mainly focus on the relationship between the capacity parameters and two robust metrics. By simulations, we find two interesting and counterintuitive results, i.e. enhancing the basic capacity of every edge may weaken the network robustness, and fixing the basic capacity of every edge, simply improving the removal capacity of every edge sometimes makes the whole network more invulnerable. These findings show that investing more maintenance resources to alleviate flow congestion is not always better to avoid the cascading propagation, which is similar to Braess's paradox in traffic networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000457001300001		J	Dong, Gaogao; Xiao, Huifang; Wang, Fan; Du, Ruijin; Shao, Shuai; Tian, Lixin; Stanley, H.

One focus of these studies has been on robustness of single clustered networks and interdependent clustered networks under random attack (RA) or hub-targeted attack. However, infrastructure networks could suffer from a damage that is localized, i.e. a group of neighboring nodes attacked or fail, a topic that was not studied earlier on clustered networks. In this paper, we analytically and via simulations study the robustness under localized attack (LA) of single Erdos-Renyi clustered network and interdependent clustered network. For generating networks with clustering we use two models: (i) double Poisson distribution (DPD) and (ii) fixed degree distribution (FDD). For the LA case, the DPD model shows a second order phase transition behavior for a single clustered network, while for dependent networks, the system undergoes a change of percolation phase transition from a first order (abrupt transition) to a second order (continuous) transition when the coupling strength q decreases below a critical value q(c). Our results imply that single networks become significantly more vulnerable with increasing clustering coefficient c with respect to LA. This is in contrast to RA where the robustness is almost independent of c. We obtain similar results when testing different real networks. For LA on dependent networks, we also observe that the system becomes more vulnerable as c increases. This is again in contrast to RA, where for, q < q(c), the system robustness is almost unaffected by increasing clustering. We also solved analytically the case of LA on random regular networks which are clustered and interdependent and find that as m (the number of clustered networks that each network depends on) or c increases, the system becomes significantly more vulnerable. We also analyzed via simulations the case of generating clustering in networks for the model of keeping a FDD, and find that the influence of clustering on the robustness of two partially interdependent networks under LA is smaller than for DPD, which is very different from these cases under RA.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1367-2630			WOS:000456276000005		J	Zhao, Jin-Hua; Zhou, Hai-Jun								Controllability and maximum matchings of complex networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	1					012317	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.012317					JAN 16 2019	2019	Previously, the controllability problem of a linear time-invariant dynamical system was mapped to the maximum matching (MM) problem on the bipartite representation of the underlying directed graph, and the sizes of MMs on random bipartite graphs were calculated analytically with the cavity method at zero temperature limit. Here we present an alternative theory to estimate MM sizes based on the core percolation theory and the perfect matching of cores. Our theory is much more simplified and easily interpreted, and can estimate MM sizes on random graphs with or without symmetry between out- and in-degree distributions. Our result helps to illuminate the fundamental connection between the controllability problem and the underlying structure of complex systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000455840200005	30780290	J	Jacob, Theju; Lillis, Kyle P.; Wang, Zemin; Swiercz, Waldemar; Rahmati, Negah; Staley, Kevin J.

Although either output state is readily modeled in silico and induced experimentally, the transition mechanisms are unknown, in part because no models exhibit both output states spontaneously. In silico small-world neural networks were built using single-compartment neurons whose physiological parameters were derived from dual whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that were generating spontaneous seizure-like activity. In silico, neurons were connected by abundant local synapses and rare long-distance synapses. Activity-dependent synaptic depression and gradual recovery delimited synchronous activity. Full synaptic recovery engendered interictal population spikes that spread via long-distance synapses. When synaptic recovery was incomplete, postsynaptic neurons required coincident activation of multiple presynaptic terminals to reach firing threshold. Only local connections were sufficiently dense to spread activity under these conditions. This coalesced network activity into traveling waves whose velocity varied with synaptic recovery. Seizures were comprised of sustained traveling waves that were similar to those recorded during experimental and human neocortical seizures. Sustained traveling waves occurred only when wave velocity, network dimensions, and the rate of synaptic recovery enabled wave reentry into previously depressed areas at precisely ictogenic levels of synaptic recovery. Wide-field, cellular-resolution GCamP7b calcium imaging demonstrated similar initial patterns of activation in the hippocampus, although the anatomical distribution of traveling waves of synaptic activation was altered by the pattern of synaptic connectivity in the organotypic hippocampal cultures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0270-6474			WOS:000455849400015	30446533	J	Liu, Chen; Guo, Hao; Li, Zhibin; Gao, Xiaoyuan; Li, Shudong								Coevolution of multi-game resolves social dilemma in network population								APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION				341				402	407		10.1016/j.amc.2018.09.019					JAN 15 2019	2019	It is an open question to understand the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in nature and society. Aim to this issue, evolutionary game theory in networked population and its various derivations, like mixing game and multi-game, have proved an effective way to resolve the social dilemma. In this work, we propose the coevolution framework of strategy and multi-game: if a player, in prisoner's dilemma game, successively keeps its strategy constant for several times (referred as memory step), it will have opportunity to participate in snow drift game, which has lower dilemma strength than prisoner's dilemma game. Of particular, it is unveiled that for short memory step, the larger the value of sucker's payoff is, the higher frequency of cooperation will be. While for long memory step, middle sucker's payoff provides a best environment for cooperation. For all these findings, we also provide theoretical analysis, which guarantees further validation.

From the perspective of computational complexity, most network reconstruction problems are non-convex, making them difficult to be efficiently solved. The majority of existing approaches extend this problem to the convex optimization problem, which leads to a final solution that is far from being completely and precisely consummated. To improve the accuracy of network reconstruction, particularly when existing algorithms cannot fully reconstruct networks, a memetic algorithm (MA) is first proposed to solve this non-convex problem directly, termed as MAST-Net. According to the problem characteristics, correction and local search operators are designed to accelerate the MA convergence speed. We apply MAST-Net to evolutionary game models, resistor networks, and communication networks taking place in synthetic and real networks and demonstrate that MAST-Net exhibits competitive performance against seven state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

Despite recent findings identifying important preterm human brain network properties such as rich-club organization, how the structural network develops differentially across brain regions and among different types of connections in this period is not yet known. Here, using high resolution diffusion MRI of 77 preterm-born and full-term neonates scanned at 31.9-41.7 postmenstrual weeks (PMW), we constructed structural connectivity matrices and performed graph-theory-based analyses. Faster increases of nodal efficiency were mainly located at the brain hubs distributed in primary sensorimotor regions, superior-middle frontal, and precuneus regions during 31.9-41.7PMW. Higher rates of edge strength increases were found in the rich-club and within-module connections, compared to other connections. The edge strength of short-range connections increased faster than that of long-range connections. Nodal efficiencies of the hubs predicted individual postmenstrual ages more accurately than those of non-hubs. Collectively, these findings revealed more rapid efficiency increases of the hub and rich-club connections as well as higher developmental rates of edge strength in short-range and within-module connections. These jointly underlie network segregation and differentiated emergence of brain functions.									1	0	0	1	0	1			1053-8119	1095-9572		WOS:000451628200059	29913282	J	Gao, Xingyu; Tian, Lixin								Effects of awareness and policy on green behavior spreading in multiplex networks								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				514				226	234		10.1016/j.physa.2018.09.067					JAN 15 2019	2019	As green behavior plays an increasingly important role today, in this paper, we aimed at investigating the spreading process of city resident green behavior. We applied classical threshold model and modified contagion model into a multiplex network to illustrate this dynamic process. Since people always act in conformity with the majorities when they make decisions or take actions, we consider the effects on negative individuals from their positive friends. Only when the proportion of centrist's positive friends surpassed the local awareness ratio a, will he become positive. Also, we consider the influence from green awareness, which facilitate the green behavior. Last but not least, compulsory policy is also taken into account because it will force specific negative individuals to take such green behavior. The theoretical analysis is conducted by microscopic Markov chain approach and the numerical simulations are performed based on the Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the intensity of policy regulation theta plays a vital role in both spreading threshold and final green behavior size. We attain a new explanation on the extinction of some behaviors and may provide advice on policy modification. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The effectiveness of the hyperbolic DC in forecasting the true importance ranking of nodes in the network structure is studied. Simulations on the forecasting accuracy show it has a certain effectiveness in forecasting a few of the most important nodes, which provides possibility to carry out targeted attacks on networks without knowing any information of network structures. Moreover, for random attacks, a mechanism based on the hyperbolic DC is designed to enhance the destructive power, and the macro-matching degree is proposed to measure the effectiveness of the mechanism. Simulations show when parameter beta is not big, the mechanism has quite good performance, and the smaller the value of beta, the more effective the mechanism. Furthermore, for parameters in the hyperbolic model, their influences on the mechanism are researched. Results show temperature has more obvious influences than curvature, and the mechanism is found to become more effective when temperature becomes lower. According to the relationship between temperature and the clustering feature of the network, the research indicates our mechanism for random attacks should be effective for most real-world networks.

In this work, we firstly present eight attack mechanisms including target attack, random failure, betweenness based attack, closeness based attack, PageRank based attack, k-shell based attack, greedy algorithm, and low-degree attack. Secondly, inspired by the dynamic node removal process, we propose to recalculate the metrics for every node removal strategy, and evaluate the network robustness against all these heuristic attack strategies with and without recalculations in scale-free networks, random networks, and many real network models. The simulations indicate that most of the attack strategies with recalculations appear to imperil the network structure security more. Furthermore, considering that key node set mining is very critical for network structure protections, we employ minimum number of key nodes (MNKN) metric to further discuss the network vulnerability against all the attack strategies with or without recalculations. The results show that the critical nodes' group can be more efficiently found under the PageRank based attack with recalculations than under other attack disciplines with or without recalculations in most of the classic and real network models. This work investigates network structure vulnerability and security from a new perspective, and has potential applications into network structure protection or planning. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many complex systems have an important feature that pairs of nodes may be connected by different types of links at the same time. In order to study the effect of the overlapped links systematically, in this paper I propose an algorithm to generate general multiplex networks with overlapped links. This algorithm could construct multiplex networks with arbitrary degree-degree distribution in each layer, and more importantly, could further adjust the proportion of overlapped links over a wide range. Therefore, the algorithm proposed in this paper offers an approach to construct multiplex networks into a delicate extent, which may provide a formal setting to study the topological impact of multiplex networks in a systematic manner.

In this paper, a new reliability model based on the fractal unit with a bigger scale than nodes and a much smaller scale than whole network is proposed for networks with fractal growth and no-loop (NF-NL). The introduced model simplifies the K-terminal reliability (KTR) of a NF-NL network to a multiplication of different KTR of fractal units in the network. The corresponding algorithm is also given, which has a linear-time complexity O(vertical bar V vertical bar) when the fractal unit scale is very small. Compared with the existing models, the proposed model provides a novel way to construct the reliability model only dependent on two factors: (1) the fractal unit characteristics and (2) its iterative process. Finally, the widely investigated Koch network case is studied with the proposed model.

Here we present a generalization of network symmetry called latent symmetry, which is an extension of the standard notion of symmetry on networks, which can be directed, weighted or both. They are defined in terms of standard symmetries in a reduced version of the network. One unique aspect of latent symmetries is that each one is associated with a size, which provides a way of discussing symmetries at multiple scales in a network. We are able to demonstrate a number of examples of networks (graphs) which contain latent symmetry, including a number of real networks. In numerical experiments, we show that latent symmetries are found more frequently in graphs built using preferential attachment, a standard model of network growth, when compared to non-network like (Erclos-Renyi) graphs. Finally we prove that if vertices in a network are latently symmetric, then they must have the same eigenvector centrality, similar to vertices which are symmetric in the standard sense. This suggests that the latent symmetries present in real-networks may serve the same structural and functional purpose standard symmetries do in these networks. We conclude from these facts and observations that latent symmetries are present in real networks and provide useful information about the network potentially beyond standard symmetries as they can appear at multiple scales.

In particular, the GRI value of the distance matrix corresponding to the evenly distributed point set in the Euclidean space is zero. Some model data were used to clarify the geometric meanings of GRI, and then we studied the GRI value of financial data. The results show that the GR1 value in the real market changes drastically and is significantly different from the GRI value of the model-generated data. These results suggest that the proposed concept (GRI) is meaningful to the study distance matrix and provides a new perspective based on the network. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, reducing network size is often at the cost of worsening network performance. Thus, there is a trade-off between the coarse-grained network sizes and network performance. To find the balance between the two sides and based on the spectral coarse-graining approach (SCG), we propose two optimization algorithms, which are called variable step size optimization algorithm (VSSOA) and variable scale optimization algorithm (VSOA). The two algorithms can calculate the optimal coarse-grained step size and the optimal scale to reduce the share size of the network. The two algorithms are applied to the coarse-graining of several typical networks. And the feasibility and validity of the proposed algorithms are further verified by phase synchronization of coupled Kuramoto oscillators on typical networks. The related investigation provides a deep insight to the coarse-graining of larg-escale complex networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims. This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots. To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems. We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level. In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network. The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60-70% of the time. We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation. The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network density, bot participation by as little as 2-4% of a communication network can be sufficient to tip over the opinion climate in two out of three cases. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which bots could shape the norms adopted by social media users.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0960-085X	1476-9344		WOS:000465718300001		J	Chen, Tinggui; Shi, Jiawen; Yang, Jianjun; Li, Gongfa								Enhancing network cluster synchronization capability based on artificial immune algorithm								HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES				9						3	10.1186/s13673-019-0164-y					JAN 11 2019	2019	With the deeper study on complex networks, more and more attention has been paid to the research on the cluster synchronization phenomena based on complex networks. In the real world, synchronization phenomena or cluster synchronous behaviors occur frequently, some of which may result in larger negative impacts to the society, such as cadmium rice event, while others bring significant economic benefits to the society, such as the synchronization of the propaganda for black Friday. Therefore, research on cluster synchronism has great values for theoretical study and social applications. Currently, the study of cluster synchronicity is focused on the solution of the synchronization threshold and the analysis of the synchronization phenomenon, etc. However, the optimization to enhance the synchronous evolutionary effect is rarely presented in literatures. To overcome these limitations of current work, we explore the optimization of network structure with artificial immune algorithms under the condition of a constant network scale and finally realize the promotion of synchronous evolution effect in this paper. Moreover, the relevant research results are applied to real cases. On one hand, for the positive synchronous behaviors, the network structure with good synchronization capability is created to achieve better synchronization. On the other hand, the connection between nodes and edges in the network is cut off to avoid the occurrence of negative synchronous behaviors.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2192-1962			WOS:000455444000001		J	Zeng, Lang; Jia, Zhen; Wang, Yingying								A new spectral coarse-graining algorithm based on K-means clustering in complex networks								MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B				33	1					1850421	10.1142/S0217984918504213					JAN 10 2019	2019	Coarse-graining of complex networks is one of the important algorithms to study large-scale networks, which is committed to reducing the size of networks while preserving some topological information or dynamic properties of the original networks. Spectral coarse-graining (SCG) is one of the typical coarse-graining algorithms, which can keep the synchronization ability of the original network well. However, the calculation of SCG is large, which limits its real-world applications. And it is difficult to accurately control the scale of the coarse-grained network. In this paper, a new SCG algorithm based on K-means clustering (KCSCG) is proposed, which cannot only reduce the amount of calculation, but also accurately control the size of coarse-grained network. At the same time, KCSCG algorithm has better effect in keeping the network synchronization ability than SCG algorithm. A large number of numerical simulations and Kuramoto-model example on several typical networks verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9849	1793-6640		WOS:000456472700006		J	Liu, Xueming; Pan, Linqiang; Stanley, H.

Although most complex network research has focused on interdependent undirected systems, many real-world networks-such as gene regulatory networks and traffic networks-are directed. We thus develop an analytical framework for examining the robustness of networks made up of directed networks of differing topologies. We use it to predict the phase transitions that occur during node failures and to generate the phase diagrams of a number of different systems, including treelike and random regular (RR) networks of directed Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks and scale-free networks. We find that the the phase transition and phase diagram of networks of directed networks differ from those of networks of undirected networks. For example, the RR networks of directed ER networks show a hybrid phase transition that does not occur in networks of undirected ER networks. In addition, system robustness is affected by network topology in networks of directed networks. As coupling strength q increases, treelike networks of directed ER networks change from a second-order phase transition to a first-order phase transition, and RR networks of directed ER networks change from a second-order phase transition to a hybrid phase transition, then to a first-order phase transition, and finally to a region of collapse. We also find that heterogenous network systems are more robust than homogeneous network systems. We note that there are multiple phase transitions and triple points in the phase diagram of RR networks of directed networks and this helps us understand how to increase network robustness when designing interdependent infrastructure systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000455062900008	30780251	J	Huang Li-Ya; Huo You-Liang; Wang Qing; Cheng Xie-Feng								Network heterogeneity based on K-order structure entropy								ACTA PHYSICA SINICA				68	1					018901	10.7498/aps.68.20181388					JAN 5 2019	2019	Structure entropy can evaluate the heterogeneity of complex networks, but traditional structure entropy has deficiencies in comprehensively reflecting the global and local network features. In this paper, we define a new structure entropy based on the number of the K-order neighbor nodes which refer to those nodes which a node can reach within K steps. It can be supposed that the more K-order neighbors a node has, the more important role the node plays in the network structure. Combining the formula of Shannon entropy, the K-order structure entropy can be defined and figured out to explain the differences among the relative importance among nodes. Meanwhile, the new structure entropy can describe the network heterogeneity from the following three aspects. The first aspect is the change tendency of structure entropy with the value of K. The second aspect is the structure entropy under a maximum influence scale K. The last aspect is the minimum value of the K-order structure entropy. The simulation compares the heterogeneities of five classic networks from the above three aspects, and the result shows that the heterogeneity strengthens in the from-weak-to -strong sequence: regular network, random network, WS (Watts-Strogatz) small-world network, BA (Barabasi-Albert) scale-free network and star network. This conclusion is consistent with the previous theoretical research result, but hard to obtain from the traditional structure entropy. It is remarkable that the K-order structure entropy can better evaluate the heterogeneity of WS small-world networks and suggests that the greater small-world coefficients a network has, the stronger heterogeneity the network has. Besides, the K-order structure entropy can fully reflect the heterogeneity variation of star networks with network size, and reasonably explain the heterogeneity of regular networks with additional isolated nodes. It suggests that when i additional isolated nodes are added to a regular network with n nodes, the new network has weaker heterogeneity than the old one, but has stronger heterogeneity than the regular network with n+i nodes. Finally, the validity of the K-order structure entropy is further confirmed by simulations for the western power grid of the United States. Based on the minimum value of the K-order structure entropy, the heterogeneity of the western power grid is the closest to that of WS small-world networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1000-3290			WOS:000455408900028		J	Amala, Arumugam; Emerson, Isaac Arnold								Identification of target genes in cancer diseases using protein-protein interaction networks								NETWORK MODELING AND ANALYSIS IN HEALTH INFORMATICS AND BIOINFORMATICS				8	1					UNSP 2	10.1007/s13721-018-0181-1					JAN 5 2019	2019	Cancer is a disease that is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth with the ability to penetrate or develop to the other parts of the body. Various studies have shown the significance of identifying drug targets for cancer, although this process continues challenging in the field of anti-cancer drug designing. The primary purpose of this study is to design a novel approach to identify target genes for cancer. The sub-network of colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancers were constructed from human protein-protein interaction network. The potential genes were analyzed using hubs and centrality measures. For the identification of target genes, we retrieve those genes that had the highest score in both mutation rates and graph centrality. Moreover, gene deletion analysis revealed that MYC, TP53, and EGFR genes remained potential targets in colorectal, pancreatic, and prostate cancer respectively. Results suggest that combining network measures with mutation frequencies in cancer genes might assist in recognizing several potential drug targets. Future enhancement of this current approach is to combine these network properties with the biological insights from gene expression data, and their functions will provide a reliable method for rational drug designing.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2192-6662	2192-6670		WOS:000454954200001		J	Brito, Samurai; Nunes, Thiago C.; da Silva, Luciano R.; Tsallis, Constantino								Scaling properties of d-dimensional complex networks								PHYSICAL REVIEW E				99	1					012305	10.1103/PhysRevE.99.012305					JAN 3 2019	2019	The area of networks is very interdisciplinary and exhibits many applications in several fields of science. Nevertheless, there are few studies focusing on geographically located d-dimensional networks. In this paper, we study the scaling properties of a wide class of d-dimensional geographically located networks which grow with preferential attachment involving Euclidean distances through r(ij)(-alpha A) (alpha(A) >= 0). We have numerically analyzed the time evolution of the connectivity of sites, the average shortest path, the degree distribution entropy, and the average clustering coefficient for d = 1, 2, 3, 4 and typical values of alpha(A). Remarkably enough, virtually all the curves can be made to collapse as functions of the scaled variable alpha(A)/d. These observations confirm the existence of three regimes. The first one occurs in the interval alpha(A)/d is an element of [0, 1]; it is non-Boltzmannian with very-long-range interactions in the sense that the degree distribution is a q exponential with q constant and above unity. The critical value alpha(A)/d = 1 that emerges in many of these properties is replaced by alpha(A)/d = 1/2 for the beta exponent which characterizes the time evolution of the connectivity of sites. The second regime is still non-Boltzmannian, now with moderately-long-range interactions, and reflects in an index q monotonically decreasing with alpha(A)/d increasing from its critical value to a characteristic value alpha(A)/d similar or equal to 5. Finally, the third regime is Boltzmannian-like (with q similar or equal to 1) and corresponds to short-range interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000454770100006	30780323	J	de Regt, Robin; von Ferber, Christian; Holovatch, Yurij; Lebovka, Mykola					Holovatch, Yurij/0000-0002-1125-2532			Public transportation in Great Britain viewed as a complex network								TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE				15	2			722	748	UNSP 160156	10.1080/23249935.2018.1529837					JAN 2 2019	2019	In this paper, we investigate the topological and spatial features of public transport networks (PTN) within Great Britain.

Using methods in complex network theory and statistical physics, we are able to discriminate PTN with respect to their stability, which is the first of this kind for national networks. Taking advantage of various fractal properties we gain useful insights into the serviceable area of stations. Moreover, we investigate universal load dynamics of these systems.

Evidence from Finance Big Data and Granger Causality Directed Network								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC COMMERCE				23	1			85	109		10.1080/10864415.2018.1512283					JAN 2 2019	2019	The recent financial network analysis approach reveals that the topologies of financial markets have an important influence on market dynamics. However, the majority of existing Finance Big Data networks are built as undirected networks without information on the influence directions among prices. Rather than understanding the correlations, this research applies the Granger causality test to build the Granger Causality Directed Network for 33 global major stock market indices. The paper further analyzes how the markets influence one another by investigating the directed edges in the different filtered networks. The network topology that evolves in different market periods is analyzed via a sliding window approach and Finance Big Data visualization. By quantifying the influences of market indices, 33 global major stock markets from the Granger causality network are ranked in comparison with the result based on PageRank centrality algorithm. Results reveal that the ranking lists are similar in both approaches where the U.S. indices dominate the top position followed by other American, European, and Asian indices. The lead-lag analysis reveals that there is lag effects among the global indices. The result sheds new insights on the influences among global stock markets with implications for trading strategy design, global portfolio management, risk management, and markets regulation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1086-4415	1557-9301		WOS:000455019800006		J	Li, Longjie; Xu, Shijin; Leng, Mingwei; Fang, Shiyu; Chen, Xiaoyun								Predicting Top-L Missing Links: An Improved Local Naive Bayes Model								IEEE ACCESS				7				57868	57880		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914724					2019	2019	The problem of link prediction has captured considerable attention from various disciplines due to its wide range of applications. A multitude of link prediction methods have been proposed with various techniques. The local Naive Bayes (LNB) model is an effective one, which discriminates the contribution of different common neighbors by a role function. This paper proposes a new link prediction method, which further enhances the accuracy of the LNB model by considering the local community links and the degree of seed nodes. The experimental results on 12 real-world networks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods in the top-L link prediction task.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000468640400001		J	Zhu, Shuaibing; Zhou, Jin; Chen, Guanrong; Lu, Jun-An								ESTIMATING THE REGION OF ATTRACTION ON A COMPLEX DYNAMICAL NETWORK								SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION				57	2			1189	1208		10.1137/18M1182498					2019	2019	Despite the prevalence of synchronization analysis on complex dynamical networks, little attention was paid to the problem of estimating their regions of attraction. This paper addresses the issue of estimating the region of attraction of an equilibrium point of a complex dynamical network, and briefly analyzes the network stability. A sufficient condition and a necessary condition are first established for the asymptotical stability of the network equilibrium point. Then, a general technique for region-of-attraction estimation is developed by combining the network structure and the node dynamics. In order to avoid the troublesome parameter selection in general region-of-attraction estimation, second-order estimation is solved under a mild additional condition. Examples are provided to verify the theoretical estimations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0363-0129	1095-7138		WOS:000466420700017		J	Xuan, Qi; Yu, Yewei; Chen, Jinyin; Ruan, Zhongyuan; Fu, Zhong; Lv, Zicong								Robustness Analysis of Bipartite Task Assignment Networks: A Case Study in Hospital Logistics System								IEEE ACCESS				7				58484	58494		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2914258					2019	2019	Task-oriented social systems involve workers and tasks, which can typically be modeled by bipartite networks. The absence of workers may cause some tasks cannot be finished in time, thus hampering the smoothing operation of the whole system. In this study, we focus on the robustness analysis of such bipartite task-oriented social networks under the absence of some workers. In particular, taking hospital logistics systems as an example, we propose four attack strategies: efficiency-based attack, centrality-based attack, diversity-based attack, and influence-based attack. The experiments on nine real hospital logistics systems show that these systems are especially vulnerable to the diversity-based attack. Different hospitals may present different patterns: some hospital logistics systems are relatively robust against these attacks while others are more vulnerable. The former hospitals are relatively small in size and adopt a global task assignment mode in which the workers can be easily replaced by others. On the contrary, the workers in the latter ones are highly professional and irreplaceable due to the large scale of the hospitals and the adoption of a regional task assignment mode. We also design two task reassignment mechanisms to model the cascading failure of such systems. In this case, the working load plays an important role in the robustness of these systems. Moreover, we find that the robustness and efficiency seem to be negatively correlated with each other, and how to balance the two in real systems still remains an open problem.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000468361400001		J	Alexiou, Athanasios; Chatzichronis, Stylianos; Perveen, Asma; Hafeez, Abdul; Ashraf, Ghulam Md.

There has been several studies of pairwise epidemic models on adaptive networks with Poisson distribution, all of which have shown that the rewiring behaviors can lead to complex dynamics numerically or analytically. However, the triples approximation formula under Poisson distribution overlooked the degree of center node of triples which has dramatic effects on the structures. Therefore in this paper, through a new moment closure incorporating the effect of center node's degree, we study how the topological structures of adaptive networks influences epidemic dynamics. The SIS pairwise epidemic model is first closed by the new triple approximation formula, then we transform the model into an equivalent nondimensionalized three dimensional system. By the qualitative theory and the stability theory of ordinary differential equations, the basic reproduction number R-0 of the model is obtained, the existence and stabilities of the equilibria are analyzed. Moreover, we prove that the model exhibits transcritical forward bifurcation, backward bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation using the methods of bifurcation theory. In addition, by a numerical example, the normal form of Hopf bifurcation and the first Lyapunov coefficient are derived, which show that a stable limit cycle can bifurcate from the endemic equilibrium with larger epidemicity. Our study show that the adaptive behavior can lead to rich dynamics on epidemic transmission, including oscillation and bistability. Finally the numerical simulations which is consistent with the analytical results above are given.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1547-1063	1551-0018		WOS:000465435500065	31137246	J	Neergaard, Karl D.; Huang, Chu-Ren								Constructing the Mandarin Phonological Network: Novel Syllable Inventory Used to Identify Schematic Segmentation								COMPLEXITY										6979830	10.1155/2019/6979830					2019	2019	The purpose of this study was to construct, measure, and identify a schematic representation of phonological processing in the tonal language Mandarin Chinese through the combination of network science and psycholinguistic tasks. Two phonological association tasks were performed with native Mandarin speakers to identify an optimal phonological annotation system. The first task served to compare two existing syllable inventories and to construct a novel system where either performed poorly. The second task validated the novel syllable inventory. In both tasks, participants were found to manipulate lexical items at each possible syllable location, but preferring to maintain whole syllables while manipulating lexical tone in their search through the mental lexicon. The optimal syllable inventory was then used as the basis of a Mandarin phonological network. Phonological edit distance was used to construct sixteen versions of the same network, which we titled phonological segmentation neighborhoods (PSNs). The sixteen PSNs were representative of every proposal to date of syllable segmentation. Syllable segmentation and whether or not lexical tone was treated as a unit both affected the PSNs' topologies. Finally, reaction times from the second task were analyzed through a model selection procedure with the goal of identifying which of the sixteen PSNs best accounted for the mental target during the task. The identification of the tonal complex-vowel segmented PSN (C_V_C_T) was indicative of the stimuli characteristics and the choices participants made while searching through the mental lexicon. The analysis revealed that participants were inhibited by greater clustering coefficient (interconnectedness of words according to phonological similarity) and facilitated by lexical frequency. This study illustrates how network science methods add to those of psycholinguistics to give insight into language processing that was not previously attainable.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526		WOS:000467097900001		J	Zheng, Zheng; Xiao, Guanping				Xiao, Guanping/O-3514-2016; Xiao, Guanping/L-3473-2019	Xiao, Guanping/0000-0002-9419-4058; Xiao, Guanping/0000-0002-9419-4058			Evolution analysis of a UAV real-time operating system from a network perspective								CHINESE JOURNAL OF AERONAUTICS				32	1			176	185		10.1016/j.cja.2018.04.011					JAN 2019	2019	With the flourishing development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the mission tasks of UAVs have become more and more complex. Consequently, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) that provides operating environments for various mission services on these UAVs has become crucial, which leads to the necessity of having a deep understanding of an RTOS. In this paper, an empirical study is conducted on FreeRTOS, a commonly used RTOS for UAVs, from a complex network perspective. A total of 85 releases of FreeRTOS, from V2.4.2 to V10.0.0, are modeled as directed networks, in which the nodes represent functions and the edges denote function calls. It is found that the size of the FreeRTOS network has grown almost linearly with the evolution of the versions, while its main core has evolved steadily. In addition, a k-core analysis-based metric is proposed to identify major functionality changes of FreeRTOS during its evolution. The result shows that the identified versions are consistent with the version change logs. Finally, it is found that the clustering coefficient of the Linux OS scheduler is larger than that of the Free-RTOS scheduler. In conclusion, the empirical results provide useful guidance for developers and users of UAV RTOSs. (C) 2018 Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

However, most methods have merely changed their population topologies into those of scale-free networks; their experimental results cannot verify that these algorithm: have superior performance. In this paper, we propose a scale-free artificial bee colony algorithm (SFABC) in which the search is guided by a scale-free network. The mechanise enables the SFABC search to follow two rules. First, the bad food sources can learn more information from the good sources of their neighbors. Second, the information exchanged among good food sources is relatively rare. To verify the effectiveness of SFABC, the algorithm is compared with the original artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), several advance ABC variants, and other metaheuristic algorithms on a wide range of benchmark functions Experimental results and statistical analyses indicate that SFABC obtains a better balance between exploration and exploitation during the optimization process and that, in most cases, it can provide a competitive performance of the benchmark functions. We also verify that scale-free networks can not only improve the optimization performance of ABC but also enhance the search ability of other metaheuristic algorithms, such as differentia evolution (DE) and the flower pollination algorithm (FPA).

However, because DCOP is known to be NP-hard, the existing DCOP techniques are often unsuitable for large-scale applications, which require distributed and scalable algorithms to deal with severely limited computing and communication. In this paper, we present a novel approach to provide approximate solutions for large-scale, complex DCOPs. This approach introduces concepts of synchronization of coupled oscillators for speeding up the convergence process towards high-quality solutions. We propose a new anytime local search DCOP algorithm, called Coupled Oscillator OPTimization (COOPT), which amounts to iteratively solving a DCOP by agents exchanging local information that brings them to a consensus. We empirically evaluate COOPT on constraint networks involving hundreds of variables with different topologies, domains, and densities. Our experimental results demonstrate that COOPT outperforms other incomplete state-of-the-art DCOP algorithms, especially in terms of the agents' communication cost and solution quality.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-9757	1943-5037		WOS:000466976900025		J	Yang, Junyuan					Yang, Junyuan/0000-0002-5825-3364			New Insight Into a Sexually Transmitted Model on Heterogeneous Networks: A Concise Approach								IEEE ACCESS				7				53534	53541		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2911336					2019	2019	Nowadays, sexually transmitted diseases have seriously threatened public health and damaged the economy.

To improve the prediction accuracy, this paper proposes a new link prediction framework by considering both node similarity and community information, which overcomes the weaknesses of existing community-based prediction methods. In the proposed framework, a reasonable measure, called community relationship strength (CRS), is defined to estimate the closeness between communities. In this paper, we hold the view that the connection likelihood between two target nodes rests upon not only their similarity but also the closeness of communities that they belong to. Therefore, to measure the connection likelihood, the proposed framework combines CRS with traditional similarity indexes. Three CRS-based methods are derived from the framework. The performance of the CRS-based methods is comprehensively studied on 12 real-world networks compared with several groups of baselines. The experimental results indicate that the CRS-based methods are more effective and robust than others.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000465578400001		J	Li, Lixiang; Liu, Qingbiao; Li, Tao								Finite-Time Synchronization of Complex Multilinks Networks with Perturbations and Time-Varying Delay Based on Nonlinear Adaptive Controller								MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING										7656820	10.1155/2019/7656820					2019	2019	This paper utilizes nonlinear adaptive feedback controller to make the complex multilinks networks with perturbations and time-varying delays achieve the finite-time synchronization.

As the payoff of the project realizes, how to share the total payoff is in consideration. With this inspiration, an investor sharing game is proposed in this paper, where investors' payoffs relate to their investing amount and the degree of monopoly in the industry market. Economically, the degree of monopoly in the market is introduced in the game by a parameter alpha that affects the evolutionary process. The distribution of investing amounts is assumed to satisfy the Pareto distribution in terms of the empirical wealth distribution. The simulation on WS small-world networks shows that cooperative behaviors will prosper by the union of investors who invest less amounts in a less monopolized market. The higher power of the Pareto distribution of investing amounts also results in more cooperators in equilibriums. Furthermore, as the degree of monopoly swings, the density of cooperators is higher and more stable in a more random small-world network. The findings may be helpful in understanding the effect of network structure on the emergence of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The research field of information spreading in complex networks has attracted extensive interest. Many spreading strategies have been proposed for improving the spreading efficiency in complex networks. However, the strategies differ in terms of performance in various complex networks. In this paper, a hybrid and effective method for improving the spreading efficiency in small-world networks and assortative scale-free networks is proposed. The proposed method can be applied to solve the essential problem of low spreading efficiency due to spreading to small-degree vertices. The proposed method combines two strategies: 1) a set of top small-degree vertices are specified as the initial spreaders and 2) vertices preferentially spread information to large-degree neighbors. Sixty-eight groups of Monte Carlo experiments are conducted in three real complex networks and seventeen synthetic complex networks. According to the experimental results and theoretical analysis, the proposed method is efficient for improving the spreading efficiency in small-world networks and assortative scale-free networks. Moreover, in assortative scale-free networks, the improvement in the spreading efficiency that is realized via the proposed method increases with the assortativity coefficient.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000465621800001		J	Xue, Fei; Lu, Shaofeng; Bompard, Ettore; Gao, Ciwei; Jiang, Lin; Wang, Xiaoliang								Node Type Distribution and Its Impacts on Performance of Power Grids								IEEE ACCESS				7				46480	46490		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2909042					2019	2019	The theory of complex networks has been studied extensively since its inception. However, until now, the impact of the node-type distributions is related to network topology and cannot be evaluated independently. In this paper, a network structure is modeled via an adjacency matrix (network topology) and a set of node type distribution vectors. Three specific issues that need to be considered for node type distributions in smart grid testing and planning are summarized in this paper. First, a set of metrics are proposed and defined to evaluate the impact of node-type distributions on network performance independently. Second, another metric named the generation distribution factor is proposed to evaluate the distribution of generation buses resulting from the specific function and purpose of power grids and by considering the distribution of load buses as given conditions. Third, another metric, i.e., the power supply redundancy metric based on entropy, is proposed to evaluate the inequality of load in power supply. Finally, a discrimination factor is defined to ensure the overall evaluation and comparison of different networks is made for this inequality. All proposed metrics can be applied to the IEEE-30, IEEE-118, IEEE-300 bus systems, as well as Italian power grid components. The simulation results indicate that the IEEE-118 system has the best node type distribution and minimum discrimination; the Italian system has the worst node-type distribution and most serious discrimination of load power supply.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000466190300001		J	Xing, Yuxuan; Liu, Fang; Xiao, Nong; Chen, Zhiguang; Lu, Yutong								Capability for Multi-Core and Many-Core Memory Systems: A Case-Study With Xeon Processors								IEEE ACCESS				7				47655	47662		10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2881460					2019	2019	The general volume of data has exploded to unimaginable levels in the past decade. Therefore, the big data analytics has become an area of focus. Many frameworks have been developed for data analytics, such as Hadoop, Spark, etc. Most of the frameworks are built on multi-core or many-core memory systems, requiring developers and users to have an in-depth understanding of the architectures to take full advantage of the hardware. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of both multi-core and many-core memory systems and discuss the different characteristics, including core, cache, memory, and the on-chip network. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective mechanism for cache false-sharing overhead that can reduce a large number of LLC-load/store instructions and LLC cache-misses. In addition, we conduct detailed experiments with Ligra, a graph analytics framework, on four different-sized datasets. The results show that it can achieve up to a 2.5x and 9.5x speed-up for multi-core and many-core memory systems, respectively. We finally share our key findings and discuss the platform development on multi-core and many-core memory systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000466063400001		J	Bertotti, M.

We compare our results with those obtained for the SIS epidemic model with the spectral method applied to adjacency matrices. It turns out that diffusion times on finite Barabasi-Albert networks are at a minimum. This may be due to a little-known property of these networks: whereas the value of the assortativity coefficient is close to zero, they look disassortative if one considers only a bounded range of degrees, including the smallest ones, and slightly assortative on the range of the higher degrees. We also find that if the trickle-down character of the diffusion process is enhanced by a larger initial stimulus on the hubs (via a inhomogeneous linear term in the Bass model), the relative difference between the diffusion times for BA networks and uncorrelated networks is even larger, reaching, for instance, the 34% in a typical case on a network with 10(4) nodes.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526		WOS:000464721900001		J	Huang, Danyang; Lan, Wei; Zhang, Hao Helen; Wang, Hansheng								Least squares estimation of spatial autoregressive models for large-scale social networks								ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS				13	1			1135	1165		10.1214/19-EJS1549					2019	2019	Due to the rapid development of various social networks, the spatial autoregressive (SAR) model is becoming an important tool in social network analysis. However, major bottlenecks remain in analyzing largescale networks (e.g., Facebook has over 700 million active users), including computational scalability, estimation consistency, and proper network sampling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel least squares estimator (LSE) for analyzing large sparse networks based on the SAR model. Computationally, the LSE is linear in the network size, making it scalable to analysis of huge networks. In theory, the LSE is root n-consistent and asymptotically normal under certain regularity conditions. A new LSE-based network sampling technique is further developed, which can automatically adjust autocorrelation between sampled and unsampled units and hence guarantee valid statistical inferences. Moreover, we generalize the LSE approach for the classical SAR model to more complex networks associated with multiple sources of social interaction effect. Numerical results for simulated and real data are presented to illustrate performance of the LSE.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1935-7524			WOS:000465088200030		J	Cisewski-Kehe, Jessi; Weller, Grant; Schafer, Chad								A preferential attachment model for the stellar initial mass function								ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF STATISTICS				13	1			1580	1607		10.1214/19-EJS1556					2019	2019	Accurate specification of a likelihood function is becoming increasingly difficult in many inference problems in astronomy. As sample sizes resulting from astronomical surveys continue to grow, deficiencies in the likelihood function lead to larger biases in key parameter estimates. These deficiencies result from the oversimplification of the physical processes that generated the data, and from the failure to account for observational limitations. Unfortunately, realistic models often do not yield an analytical form for the likelihood. The estimation of a stellar initial mass function (IMF) is an important example. The stellar IMF is the mass distribution of stars initially formed in a given cluster of stars, a population which is not directly observable due to stellar evolution and other disruptions and observational limitations of the cluster. There are several difficulties with specifying a likelihood in this setting since the physical processes and observational challenges result in measurable masses that cannot legitimately be considered independent draws from an IMF. This work improves inference of the IMF by using an approximate Bayesian computation approach that both accounts for observational and astrophysical effects and incorporates a physically-motivated model for star cluster formation. The methodology is illustrated via a simulation study, demonstrating that the proposed approach can recover the true posterior in realistic situations, and applied to observations from astrophysical simulation data.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1935-7524			WOS:000465088200040		J	Zhou, Yousheng; Wu, Chujun; Zhu, Qingyi; Xiang, Yong; Loke, Seng W.

Two issues are the veracity and provenance of posted information, including rumors. There is a need for methods for tracing rumors (or any piece of information) to their most likely source in such networks. We consider the detection problem of single rumor source based on observed snapshots based on the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model. According to the SEIR model, all nodes in the network are formulated into four possible states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R). Given an observed snapshot in the network, from which we can know the relevant graph topology and all infected nodes, but where nodes in susceptible, exposed, or recovered status cannot be distinguished, the purpose of our research is to identify the rumor source based on the observed snapshot and graph topology. We propose the concept of the optimal infection process and derive an estimator for the rumor source based on this optimal infection process. Subsequently, we prove that this estimator matches the rumor source with a high probability. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated using experiments based on regular tree networks with different degrees. We further evaluate the performance of our scheme on two well-known synthetic complex networks and four real-world networks; the results suggest that our proposed scheme outperforms the traditional rumor centrality heuristics. The performance analysis on computational complexity demonstrates that our scheme has advantages in efficiency compared with other rumor centrality heuristics used in rumor detection methods.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000465272300001		J	Wiedemann, Felix								The Local and the Global in Networks of Lebanese and Algerian Rappers								OPEN LIBRARY OF HUMANITIES				5	1					26	10.16995/olh.419					2019	2019	This article discusses border-crossing interconnections and processes of glocalization in Arab(ic) hip hop culture. It is based on an analysis of collaborative networks among Lebanese and Algerian rappers, and their Twitter networks. This approach is grounded in relational sociology, which assumes that culture is the product of interactions between individuals. Here, two interactions are modeled and analyzed as networks. At first, featurings as a form of artistic collaboration are examined. Secondly, Twitter followings, as an important form of online communication, are focused on. By analyzing network-structures like clusters and node properties like the number of connections to other nodes (degree), this article takes a quantitative viewpoint on a subject matter usually analyzed by qualitative tools. The article's findings indicate the parallel existence of an Algerian and an Eastern Arab(ic) hip hop community excluding the Maghreb region. Both communities have social media connections to the US-American hip hop scene, while French hip hop seems to only play a bigger role in Algeria.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2056-6700			WOS:000464652600026		J	Ribas, Lucas Correia; Neiva, Mariane Barros; Bruno, Odemir Martinez				Sao Carlos Institute of Physics, IFSC/USP/M-2664-2016	Correia Ribas, Lucas/0000-0003-2490-180X			Distance transform network for shape analysis								INFORMATION SCIENCES				470				28	42		10.1016/j.ins.2018.08.038					JAN 2019	2019	Shape is known as an important source of information in object analyzes and has been studied for many years for this context. In the object classification task, several challenges such as variations in rotation and scale, noise, and degradation make the problem even harder. This paper proposes the Distance Transform Network (DTN), which combines the power of networks and the richness of information provided from Euclidean distance transform for shape analysis. First, a distance map is obtained by the application of the Euclidean distance transform on each contour. Thus, each radius of dilatation is modeled as a network. Then, degree measurements of the dynamic evolution network are used to characterize the contour. Finally, a robust feature vector is composed by characteristics of different radiuses of dilatation. The methodology was tested in seven benchmarks available databases, including two otolith and three sets containing shape of leaves species which presents challenging contours with a lot of intra-class variations. The results against literature methods show that the proposed DTN is effective for natural shapes classification according to the higher success rates obtained in all cases. The advantages of our approach include robustness to degradation and noise, and tolerance to variations in the shapes scale and orientation.

Inspired by this, we thus study the evolution of public cooperation on two interdependent networks that are connected by means of an asymmetric information sharing updating function, which can construct the interdependent networks in two different classes in order to simulate asymmetric influence of multiple networks which exist in from bacteria to animals as well as human societies. Interestingly, we find that interdependence by means of asymmetric information sharing function can dramatically promote the evolution of cooperation by restraining negative feed-back effect to provide a better environment for cooperators to mushroom. The result shows that the stronger the level of asymmetry, the higher the level of cooperation. And we further inquiry why this asymmetric information sharing updating mechanism can strikingly promote the cooperation in the upper network and find that the value of combined Fermi-Dirac Function of defector in the upper network is relatively larger than the original Fermi-Dirac Function, which can eventually lead to the fraction of cooperation to one in the upper network. Our work can reveal some essential principles in asymmetric interdependent networks that ubiquitously exists in biological and human social systems.

Empirical evidence reveals that little is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is established when a connection is built among two or more previously disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142 different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are constantly born, live for some time, and then die. We also provide a Web-based application that helps characterize and understand the content of extracted communities. This study clearly shows that the evolution of MEDLINE knowledge correlates with the network's structural and temporal characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1532-0464	1532-0480		WOS:000462243300008	30529574	J	Dolgorsuren, Batjargal; Khan, Kifayat Ullah; Rasel, Mostofa Kamal; Lee, Young-Koo								StarZIP: Streaming Graph Compression Technique for Data Archiving								IEEE ACCESS				7				38020	38034		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2899921					2019	2019	The size of a streaming graph is possibly unbounded, and it is updated by a continuous sequence of edges over time. Due to numerous types of real-world interactions, the nature of edge arrival in a streaming graph is dynamic and holds different types of temporal subgraphs, such as stars, bipartite forms, cliques, and chains. The most current techniques find such subgraphs in each snapshot of a dynamic graph and use a dictionary or hash-based summary to compress the graph before applying a stitching technique to demonstrate its temporal behavior. However, it remains difficult to discover those subgraph structures from the continuous stream of edges found in large and rapidly changing dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose a streaming graph compression algorithm, StarZIP, that uses a new encoding scheme. Our motivational factor is real-world graphs that contain an overwhelmingly large number of stars and a few other structures. We have observed that all subgraph structures can be represented as star-shaped subgraphs. Moreover, the star-shaped representation can easily be arranged in the form of an inverted index, which enables the application of different inverted list encoding techniques for compression. Therefore, we shatter a graph into a uniform representation of stars to compress it. The evaluation of StarZIP on real-world datasets shows that our proposed system reduced the size of a highly dense graph to 60 times less than its original size. Moreover, the experimental results indicate that StarZIP compression is 4 times better than the stateof-the-art techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463642100001		J	Kamola, Mariusz								How to Verify Conway's Law for Open Source Projects								IEEE ACCESS				7				38469	38480		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2905671					2019	2019	Conway's Law states that in successful software projects, the organizational structure of programmer teams corresponds to the architecture of the developed system. It means that, ideally, each developer team works on its software module, and only on that module. We propose an approach to assess the difference between code structure and organizational structure. It is based on agglomerative clustering of modules and developers, followed by the search for best possible mapping between the groups. We applied the approach to a number of popular open source projects. The results show that these projects hardly obey Conway's law, due to the scale-free nature of both types of deduced networks, i.e., of software modules and the developers.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463937000001		J	Ramos, Amandine; Manizan, Lola; Rodriguez, Esther; Kemp, Yvonne J.

The current knowledge of social organization in the European bison (Bison bonasus) is still largely based on descriptions of group compositions, most of which were obtained during opportunistic field observations. However, the numerous conservation programs for this species can only implement effective management decisions after the analysis of its social structures. For instance, the removal of a key individual can disturb the social stability of a group and thus indirectly affect the fitness of group members. This is the first study that uses social network analysis to examine the social structure of a semi-free ranging bison herd (N = 14). Closest neighbour associations are used to calculate the eigenvector centrality and individual social strength of each animal. These two indices are combined after a principal component analysis (PCA) to form the Sociability variable, which was then tested for correlations with age, dominance rank, number of matrilines and reproductive status (lactating vs non-lactating). Results reveal strong group cohesion, with a close association of individuals belonging to the same matriline within the herd. The cumulative distribution of the eigenvector centralities follows a linear function, meaning that no individual has a highly central position compared to its congeners. Finally, a high Sociability value was not correlated to age, dominance rank or number of matrilines, but was dependent on the reproductive status of females. These results indicate the necessity to consider the social welfare of animals, for instance by taking matrilineal relationships into account when making bison groups management decisions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0376-6357	1872-8308		WOS:000456221100014	30445118	J	DasGupta, Bhaskar; Mobasheri, Nasim; Yero, Ismael G.

In this article we investigate, both theoretically and empirically, privacy violation measures of large networks under active attacks that was recently introduced in Trujillo-Rasua and Yero (2016). Our theoretical result indicates that the network manager responsible for prevention of privacy violation must be very careful in designing the network if its topology does not contain a cycle. Our empirical results shed light on privacy violation properties of eight real social networks as well as a large number of synthetic networks generated by both the classical Erdos-Renyi model and the scale-free random networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment model.

Due to the fact that complex networks, in reality, could suffer from manifold perturbations and network components could break down, it is, therefore, pivotal to investigate the robustness of complex networks in the face of perturbations. In the literature, enormous endeavors have been made to study network robustness. However, existing studies mainly deal with the interdependent networks, while little attention is paid to study the robustness of bipartite networks. Many networks, such as economical networks and biological networks, can be modeled as bipartite networks. It is therefore important to study the robustness of bipartite networks. Because the structures of bipartite networks differ from that of networks in common sense, existing robustness analysis methods cannot be applied to bipartite networks. With regard to this, this paper proposes a generic method based on the probabilistic theory to assess the robustness of bipartite networks under random node failures. The proposed method mathematically indicates that bipartite networks are robust to random perturbations. The experiments on random bipartite Erdos-Renyi and scale-free networks demonstrate that the theoretical results yielded by the proposed method coincide quite well with the simulation results. This paper also compares the proposed method against the well-studied method. The experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms the comparison method.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463716300001		J	Sriram, Lalitha Madhavi Konila; Ulak, Mehmet Baran; Ozguven, Eren Erman; Arghandeh, Reza				; Arghandeh, Reza/M-4895-2013	Konila Sriram, Lalitha Madhavi/0000-0003-0655-3776; Arghandeh, Reza/0000-0002-0691-5426			Multi-Network Vulnerability Causal Model for Infrastructure Co-Resilience								IEEE ACCESS				7				35344	35358		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2904457					2019	2019	Resilience is mostly considered as a single-dimension attribute of a system. Most of the recent works on resilience treat it as a single-dimension attribute of a system or study the different dimensions of the resilience separately without considering its multi-domain nature. In this paper, we propose an advanced causal inference approach combined with machine learning to characterize the spatio-temporal and multi-domain vulnerability of an urban infrastructure system against extreme weather events. With the proposed causality approach, we perform vulnerability assessment for electricity outages and roadway closures through considering the meteorological, topographic, and demographic attributes of urban areas in the aftermath of the extreme weather events. This proposed holistic approach to multi-network vulnerability assessment paves the ground for characterizing the resilience in a multi-network scheme, which is coined as the concept of "co-resilience." The proposed causal framework for multi-network vulnerability assessment is validated using the actual data for the impacts of the Hurricane Hermine 2016 and the January Storm 2017 on the Tallahassee, FL, USA. The results achieved from the proposed causality approach indicate a high causal relationship among electricity outages, roadway closures, topographic aspects, and meteorological variables in an urban area. Findings show that the proposed multi-network approach for vulnerability assessment improves the performance of the estimation and prediction of the disaster outcomes and the evaluation of the overall system resilience.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463454400001		J	Wang, Chao; Koh, Jin Ming; Cheong, Kang Hao; Xie, Neng-Gang					Cheong, Kang Hao/0000-0002-4475-5451			Progressive Information Polarization in a Complex-Network Entropic Social Dynamics Model								IEEE ACCESS				7				35394	35404		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2902400					2019	2019	The advent of social media and technologies augmenting social communication has dramatically amplified the role of rumor spreading in shaping society, via means of misinformation and fact distortion. Existing research commonly utilize contagion mechanisms, statistical mechanics frameworks, or complex-network opinion dynamics models. In this paper, we incorporate information distortion and polarization effects into an opinion dynamics model based on information entropy, modeling imprecision in human memory and communication, and the consequent progressive drift of information toward subjective extremes. Simulation results predict a wide variety of possible system behavior, heavily dependent on the relative trust placed on individuals of differing social connectivity. Mass-polarization toward a positive or negative consensus occurs when a synergistic mechanism between preferential trust and polarization tendencies is sustained; a division of the population into segregated groups of different polarity is also possible under certain conditions. These results may aid in the analysis and prediction of opinion polarization phenomena on social platforms, and the presented agent-based modeling approach may aid in the simulation of complex-network information systems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463455500001		J	Razaee, Zahra S.; Amini, Arash A.; Li, Jingyi Jessica								Matched Bipartite Block Model with Covariates								JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH				20						34						2019	2019	Community detection or clustering is a fundamental task in the analysis of network data.

First, the characteristics of C2 supernetworks are analyzed to abstract their nodes and hyperedges, based on which, we propose the (MCS)-S-2 model, which consists of three layers and five networks. Second, the Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency and spatial distance algorithms are used to construct an attribute synergy prioritization-based strategy for the generation of intra-layer (MCS)-S-2 hyperedges, while the local-world (LW) selection is used to create an LW model-based method for the generation of inter-layer (MCS)-S-2 hyperedges. Through simulation experiments, we show that our model exhibits (approximately) scale-free properties as well as small-world properties, excellent cooperative engagement capabilities, and has a high level of network invulnerability. These findings will serve as a useful reference for the description of complex nodal (edge) relationships in C2 networks, network performance analyses, and deployment of complex combat mission networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000463043900001		J	Giudice, Paolo Lolo; Ursino, Domenico; Mammone, Nadia; Morabito, Francesco Carlo; Aguglia, Umberto; Cianci, Vittoria; Ferlazzo, Edoardo; Gasparini, Sara					Ursino, Domenico/0000-0003-1360-8499; MORABITO, Francesco Carlo/0000-0003-0734-9136			A network analysis based approach to characterizing periodic sharp wave complexes in electroencephalograms of patients with sporadic CJD								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS				121				19	29		10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2018.11.003					JAN 2019	2019	Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, uniformly fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. Sporadic CJD (sCJD) is the most common form of CJD. Electroencephalography (EEG) is one of the main methods to perform clinical diagnosis of CJD, mainly because of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs). In this paper, we propose a network analysis based approach to characterizing PSWCs in EEGs of patients with sCJD. Our approach associates a network with each EEG at disposal and defines a new numerical coefficient and some network motifs, which characterize the presence of PSWCs in an EEG tracing. The new coefficient, called connection coefficient, and the detected network motifs are capable of characterizing the EEG tracing segments with PSWCs. Furthermore, network motifs are able to detect what are the most active and/or connected brain areas in the tracing segments with PSWCs. The results obtained show that, analogously to what happens for other neurological diseases, network analysis can be successfully exploited to investigate sCJD.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1386-5056	1872-8243		WOS:000452711300003	30545486	J	Lin, Yuan; Zhang, Zhongzhi				Zhang, Zhongzhi/G-5522-2011				Non-Backtracking Centrality Based Random Walk on Networks								COMPUTER JOURNAL				62	1			63	80		10.1093/comjnl/bxy028					JAN 2019	2019	Random walks are a fundamental tool for analyzing realistic complex networked systems and implementing randomized algorithms to solve diverse problems such as searching and sampling. For many real applications, their actual effect and convenience depend on the properties (e.g. stationary distribution and hitting time) of random walks, with biased random walks often outperforming traditional unbiased random walks (TURW). In this paper, we present a new class of biased random walks, non-backtracking centrality based random walks (NBCRW) on a network, where the walker prefers to jump to neighbors with high non-backtracking centrality that has some advantages over eigenvector centrality. We study some properties of the non-backtracking matrix of a network, on the basis of which we propose a theoretical framework for fast computation of the transition probabilities, stationary distribution and hitting times for NBCRW on the network. Within the paradigm, we study NBCRW on some model and real networks and compare the results with those corresponding to TURW and maximal entropy random walks (MERW), with the latter being biased random walks based on eigenvector centrality. We show that the behaviors of stationary distribution and hitting times for NBCRW widely differ from those associated with TURW and MERW, especially for heterogeneous networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0010-4620	1460-2067		WOS:000462595500005		J	de Marti, Joan; Milan, Pau								Regime change in large information networks								GAMES AND ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR				113				262	284		10.1016/j.geb.2018.09.010					JAN 2019	2019	We study global games of regime change within networks of truthful communication. Agents can choose between attacking and not attacking a status quo, whose strength is unknown. Players share private signals of the state with their immediate neighbors. Communication with neighbors introduces local correlations in posterior beliefs, and also pools information. In order to isolate the latter effect, we provide sparseness conditions on networks that allow for asymptotic approximations that eliminate covariances from equilibrium strategies. We ask how changes in the distribution of connectivities in the population affect the type of coordination in equilibrium as well as the likelihood of successful rally. We find that, without public signals, strategic incentives align and the probability of success remains independent of the network. With a public signal, the distribution of degrees unambiguously affects the probability of success, although the direction of change is not monotone and depends on the cost of attacking.

Geometric routing, which guarantees scalability, efficiency, and mobility, is a promising routing scheme for mobile services in the resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT). However, the private data transmitted by geometric routing may be eavesdropped by the malicious node and the privacy-preserving becomes one of the important issues for the mobile service in IoTs. Due to the resource constrains, approaches using encryption or hashing are not suitable for geometric routing. In this paper, we propose a lightweight anonymous geometric routing (LAGER) to protect the node-related private data. Instead of using the encryption or hashing approach, LAGER adopts a coordinate confusion mechanism which provides each node an anonymous coordinate of virtual node, such that the private data is decoupled from the node coordinate. The malicious node cannot determine which node the data belongs to even if it obtains the private data. To support the data transmission with anonymous coordinates, LAGER adopts a hybrid routing scheme by combining the greedy routing and a source routing. The experiment results show that LAGER provides effective anonymity with acceptable costs of scalability and efficiency.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000462465700001		J	De Moura Filho, Silvio Liberato; Rocha, Angela Machado; Teles, Eduardo Oliveira; Torres, Ednildo Andrade								THE SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS DESVENDING THE INNOVATION MANAGEMENT								REVISTA GEINTEC-GESTAO INOVACAO E TECNOLOGIAS				9	1			4725	4739		10.7198/geintec.v9i1.1310					JAN-MAR 2019	2019	The production, diffusion and exchange of knowledge are raw materials in the process of innovation, causing the formation of so-called Social Networks.

A total of 2.039 papers were collected from scientific journals and, based on sequential criteria, 29 papers were selected, generating 120 keywords and 1,797 citations, and two networks were built: Keyword and Citation networks. The analysis demonstrates that the three main areas that characterize the theme are: Portfolio Management, Internal Competencies and Collaboration Networks.

Our analysis is based on data collected in two consecutive surveys, conducted in 2005 and 2012, of entrepreneurs in the electronics cluster in Crdoba. We find that social and institutional factors influence micro-connectivity choices at the local level, while firms that are more open to non-local knowledge have the tendency to behave like external stars, potentially limiting the flow of non-locally generated knowledge into the cluster network as it grows. We interpret these results using the intuitions from strain theory and suggest that strain may engender an everyone for themselves mentality in the most open cluster firms as they seek to escape from a condition of underperformance. We posit, also, that local social and institutional ties are relevant for most cluster firms to survive, but are not sufficient for the cluster to thrive.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1468-2702	1468-2710		WOS:000462157200006		J	Candia, Cristian; Jara-Figueroa, C.; Rodriguez-Sickert, Carlos; Barabasi, Albert-Laszlo; Hidalgo, Cesar A.

Here, we use data on the citation of academic articles and patents, and on the online attention received by songs, movies and biographies, to describe the temporal decay of the attention received by cultural products. We show that, once we isolate the temporal dimension of the decay, the attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function. We explain this universality by proposing a mathematical model based on communicative and cultural memory, which fits the data better than previously proposed log-normal and exponential models. Our results reveal that biographies remain in our communicative memory the longest (20-30 years) and music the shortest (about 5.6 years). These findings show that the average attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function.									3	0	0	2	0	3			2397-3374			WOS:000455533200023	30932052	J	Lassiter, Charles								Sham Epistemic Authority and Implicit Racial Bias								SOCIAL EPISTEMOLOGY				33	1			42	60		10.1080/02691728.2018.1552995					2019	2019	In this paper, I argue for a way to evaluate beliefs grounded in the testimony of sham epistemic authorities and then apply that principle to beliefs tokened as a consequence of implicit biases.

Network structures are often seen in many urban systems, such as urban transport system and urban functional networks; these networked urban systems can be described as social networks in which the nodes denote the individuals in the systems and the edges denote the relationships among the individuals. In the evolution of these networked systems, individual attributes play an important role but which were often ignored in previous studies. To address the effects of individual attributes in the evolution of networked systems, this paper presents an energy-based model to simulate the coevolution of network structures and individual attributes in social networks. Each node is endowed with an attribute vector representing its place in a multidimensional space. The evolution can be viewed as interaction among nodes, moving closer or farer away; an edge exists only when its two endpoints' distance is lower than a threshold. Every node tends to move to a low-energy place driven by attractive force from its immediate neighbors and repulsion force from all other nodes. A new place means a change of attributes. The simulation results show that individual attributes change in the evolution process while keeping the power-law degree distribution and generating clusters. Therefore, the energy model can imitate some complex social phenomena in networked urban systems by simple repulsion and attraction rules.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1300-1361			WOS:000461678300482		J	Zhao, Guyu; Huang, Guoyan; He, Hongdou; Wang, Qian					Zhao, Guyu/0000-0002-1198-8662			Innovative Spatial-Temporal Network Modeling and Analysis Method of Air Quaility								IEEE ACCESS				7							10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900997					2019	2019	Air quality system is characterized by dynamism, dependency, and complexity. Scientifically representing the internal structure of air mass distribution and its relationship to reveal the dynamic evolution of air quality is the key to solve the air pollution problem. This paper abstracts the air quality system into the complex network innovatively by synthesizing spatial and temporal factors influencing air quality status. Based on quantifying the regional dynamic interconnection and interaction, our modeling approach is proposed to mine the relationship of different regions. First, the dynamic time-varying nature of air pollutant concentration is essential to get the interaction frequency of local air quality in the time dimension. The time correlation analysis of air quality nodes is conducted by calculating the time correlation matrix to construct the air quality network topology. Second, spatial distance and wind are the main factors influencing the diffusion of pollutants, which is used to characterize spatial homogeneity and heterogeneity. By computing the spatial correlation matrix, the spatial interaction intensity is quantified. Then, air quality spatiotemporal model is established by integrating the temporal and spatial correlation. Finally, based on the air quality spatiotemporal network model, community detecting algorithms are used to mine the local similarity and regional interaction. We evaluated our model with extensive experiments based on real data. The results show that our model is dynamic, reliable, and scalable. Utilizing the characteristics of the complex network community, our approach reflects the local and propagating characteristics of air quality and lays the foundation for air pollution prevention and further prediction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000462125500001		J	Ochoa-Aday, Leonardo; Cervello-Pastor, Cristina; Fernandez-Fernandez, Adriana				Cervello-Pastor, Cristina/E-3720-2016	Cervello-Pastor, Cristina/0000-0002-8056-0774			eTDP: Enhanced Topology Discovery Protocol for Software-Defined Networks								IEEE ACCESS				7				23471	23487		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2899653					2019	2019	Discovering network elements in a dynamic and optimized manner and being able to contend with ever-growing traffic is a key requirement for current networking environments. In software-defined networks (SDNs), the controller collects the topology information from the data plane and maintains an abstract view of the entire network, which is crucial for the proper functioning of applications and network services. However, there is still the need for an enhanced protocol for automatic discovery and mechanisms of autoconfiguration of network elements according to new policies and business requirements. To overcome this challenge, this paper presents a novel protocol that, unlike existing approaches, enables a distributed layer-2 discovery without the need for previous network configurations or controller knowledge of the network. By using this mechanism, the SDN controller can discover the network view without incurring scalability issues, while taking advantage of the shortest control paths toward each switch. The obtained results show that our enhanced protocol is efficient in terms of time and message load over a wide range of generated networks and outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000461011000001		J	Yang, Junyuan; Xu, Fei					Yang, Junyuan/0000-0002-5825-3364			The Computational Approach for the Basic Reproduction Number of Epidemic Mode is on Complex Networks								IEEE ACCESS				7				26474	26479		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2898639					2019	2019	The basic reproduction number plays an important role in exploring the dynamics of the epidemic models. Such value has been extensively used in the estimation of how severe an epidemic outbreak. Although several methods for calculating the basic reproduction number has been proposed, there isn't an effectively universal method to estimate such value. In this paper, we propose a general approach to calculate the explicit formulation of the basic reproduction number by the renewal equation. We apply such a method to estimate the basic reproduction number of many epidemic models on complex networks consisting of mean-field models, pairwise models, and edge-based compartmental models.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2169-3536			WOS:000461687900001		J	Shi, Benyun; Liu, Guangliang; Qiu, Hongjun; Chen, Yu-Wang; Peng, Shaoliang				Chen, Yu-wang/A-1129-2019	Chen, Yu-wang/0000-0002-2007-1821			Voluntary Vaccination through Perceiving Epidemic Severity in Social Networks								COMPLEXITY										3901218	10.1155/2019/3901218					2019	2019	The severity of an epidemic has a significant impact on individual vaccinating decisions under voluntary vaccination. During the epidemic of a vaccine-preventable disease, individuals in a social network can perceive the infection risks based on global information announced by public health authorities, or local information obtained from their social neighbors. After that, they can rationally decide whether or not to take the vaccine through weighing the relative cost of vaccination and infection (i.e., relative vaccine cost). In this case, both social network structure and individuals' risk perception strategies will affect the final vaccine coverage. In this paper, we focus on the problem of how individuals' perceptions on epidemic severity affect their vaccinating behaviors in the face of flu-like seasonal diseases in social networks, and vice versa. Specifically, we first present three types of static decision-making mechanisms, each of which simulates human vaccinating behaviors based on different local/global information. On this basis, we further present a reinforcement-learning-based mechanism, where individuals can use their historical vaccination experiences to determine what information is more suitable to estimate the severity of the epidemic. Finally, we carry out simulations on three types of social networks to investigate the effects of network structure, source of information, relative vaccine cost, and individual social connections on the final vaccine coverage and epidemic size. The results and findings can provide a new insight for designing incentive-based vaccination policies and intervention strategies for flu-like seasonal diseases.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526		WOS:000460224000001		J	Di Stefano, Alessandro; Scata, Marialisa; Vijayakumar, Supreeta; Angione, Claudio; La Corte, Aurelio; Lio, Pietro				La Corte, Aurelio/H-4519-2017	LaCorte, Aurelio/0000-0003-0370-7717; Angione, Claudio/0000-0002-3140-7909; Vijayakumar, Supreeta/0000-0001-6357-0439			Social dynamics modeling of chrono-nutrition								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				15	1					e1006714	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006714					JAN 2019	2019	Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the "gut-human behavior axis" and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and "chrono-nutrition" play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions.									1	0	0	1	0	1				1553-7358		WOS:000457372500039	30699206	S	Annunziata, Alfonso; Pisano, Carlo						Calabro, F; DellaSpina, L; Bevilacqua, C		The Myth of Pedestrianisation or the Reasons of Hierarchy								NEW METROPOLITAN PERSPECTIVES: LOCAL KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION DYNAMICS TOWARDS TERRITORY ATTRACTIVENESS THROUGH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF HORIZON/E2020/AGENDA2030, VOL 2		Smart Innovation Systems and Technologies		101				172	181		10.1007/978-3-319-92102-0_19					2019	2019	The rediscovery of the functional and symbolic role of environmental networks, cycling and pedestrian paths, and open spaces, particularly in the urban realm, leads to an increasing sensitivity to the discontinuity of territories generated by the main mobility networks. Thus, an instance of domestication emerges, resulting in transformation strategies of large mobility infrastructures - or their portions - into multi-functional pedestrian spaces. However, pedestrianisation interventions have not been completely defined within a theoretical system that clearly establishes modes and conditions of implementation. This article aims to point out how the conditions of hierarchy constitute a supporting tool for controlling and verifying the project of pedestrianisation. The article focuses on a concrete case of modification of an urban road network: the transformation of a portion of an important distributor road in the urban area of Cagliari into a pedestrian space. This analysis uses the fundamental conditions of hierarchy as a tool to assess to what extent the modification of the road network articulation has resulted in conditions of lesser inter-connectivity, legibility and functionality.					3rd International Symposium on New Metropolitan Perspectives - Local Knowledge and Innovation Dynamics Towards Territory Attractiveness Through the Implementation of Horizon/Europe2020/Agenda20303rd International Symposium on New Metropolitan Perspectives - Local Knowledge and Innovation Dynamics Towards Territory Attractiveness Through the Implementation of Horizon/Europe2020/Agenda2030	MAY 22-25, 2018MAY 22-25, 2018	KES IntKES Int	Reggio Calabria, ITALYReggio Calabria, ITALY	0	0	0	0	0	0			2190-3018		978-3-319-92102-0	WOS:000460948500019		J	Liu, Weiyi; Chen, Pin-Yu; Yu, Fucai; Suzumura, Toyotaro; Hu, Guangmin								Learning Graph Topological Features via GAN								IEEE ACCESS				7				21834	21843		10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2898693					2019	2019	Inspired by the generation power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in image domains, we introduce a novel hierarchical architecture for learning characteristic topological features from a single arbitrary input graph via GANs. The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input graph into representative "stages'' for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. The experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages (unlike a single GAN, which cannot easily identify such features, let alone reconstruct the original graph). This paper is the firstline research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000460583200001		J	Zhou, Jian; Cai, Ning; Tan, Zong-Yuan; Khan, M.

By efficiently synthesizing the degree and the dynamic queue length of nodes, we propose the global hybrid (GH) routing strategy. It can achieve higher traffic capacity, as well as shorter average packets, travel time compared with the state-of-the-art global dynamic (GD) routing strategy and efficient routing (ER) strategy. Moreover, such superiority can be maintained through the queue length information and the corresponding routing paths are updated periodically. The simulation results show that our GH routing strategy can provide the same traffic capacity as the GD routing strategy does, which is more than twice as high as the ER strategy. At the same time, the average packets travel time of the GH routing strategy is more than 20% smaller than that of the GD routing strategy. It is worth noted that longer updating delay makes our GH routing strategy have a greater decline in the average packets travel time. With the updating delay equals 100, the decline can be up to 40%. To illustrate the practicability of our GH routing strategy, we also applied it to a scale-free network-based data center network. The simulation results reveal that it is practical, effective, and can be used in real scenarios to improve network performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000459780100001		J	Furtado, Bernardo A.; Fuentes, Miguel A.; Tessone, Claudio J.

Further, we illustrate some specific experiences of large applied projects in macroeconomics, urban systems, and infrastructure planning. We argue that agent-based modeling has established itself as a strong tool within scientific realm. However, adoption by policy-makers is still scarce.

Compared with the consensus protocols without pinning control, the proposed finite-time and fixed-time protocols need to control only a small fraction of agents, which is practical and has advantages from the physical viewpoint of energy consumption. More specifically, the deterministic and stochastic protocols include the graph (p + 1)-Laplacian, a nonlinear generalization of the standard graph Laplacian. We show that, unlike the protocols with the standard (linear) graph Laplacian, those with the graph (p + 1)-Laplacian solve the finite-time as well as the fixed-time consensus problems. By using the finite-time and fixed-time stability theory and the algebra graph theory, sufficient conditions are established to ensure the finite-time and fixed-time consensus. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the correctness of the theoretical results.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-1399	1095-712X		WOS:000460127100006		J	Liu, Weiyan; Li, Xin; Liu, Tao; Liu, Bin								Approximating Betweenness Centrality to Identify Key Nodes in a Weighted Urban Complex Transportation Network								JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION										9024745	10.1155/2019/9024745					2019	2019	The key nodes in a complex transportation network have a significant influence on the safety of traffic operations, connectivity reliability, and the performance of the entire network. However, the identification of key nodes in existing urban transportation networks has mainly focused on nonweighted networks and the network information of the nodes themselves, which do not accurately reflect their global status. Thus, the present study proposes a key node identification algorithm that combines traffic flow features and is based on weighted betweenness centrality. This study also uses weighted roads to construct an L-space weighted transportation network and an approximate algorithm for betweenness centrality in order to reduce the complexity of the calculations. The results of the simulation indicate that the proposed algorithm is not only capable of identifying the key nodes in a relatively short amount of time, but it does so with high accuracy. The findings of this study can be used to provide decision-making support for road network management, planning, and urban traffic construction optimization.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0197-6729	2042-3195		WOS:000460241800001		J	Janson, Svante								Random Recursive Trees and Preferential Attachment Trees are Random Split Trees								COMBINATORICS PROBABILITY & COMPUTING				28	1			81	99		10.1017/S0963548318000226					JAN 2019	2019	We consider linear preferential attachment trees, and show that they can be regarded as random split trees in the sense of Devroye (1999), although with infinite potential branching.

Through phase space reconstruction, a time series was transformed into a high-dimensional recurrence network and a corresponding low-dimensional recurrence network, respectively. Then, two appropriate statistics, the correlation coefficient of node degrees (CCND) and the edge similarity, were proposed to unravel the evolution properties of the considered signal. Through the investigation of the time series with distinct dynamics, different patterns in the decline rate of the CCND at different network dimensions were observed. Interestingly, an exponential scaling emerged in the CCND analysis for the chaotic time series. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the edge similarity can further characterize dynamical systems and provide detailed information on the studied time series. A method based on the fluctuation of edge similarities for neighboring edge groups was proposed to determine the number of groups that the edges should be partitioned into. Through the analysis of chaotic series corrupted by noise, it was demonstrated that both the CCND and edge similarity derived from different time series are robust under additive noise. Finally, the application of the proposed method to ventricular time series showed its effectiveness in differentiating healthy subjects from ventricular tachycardia (VT) patients.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000459740300045		J	Viljoen, Nadia M.; Joubert, Johan W.

A deeper understanding of the geography and trends of urban freight transport must recognise that it is the aggregate result of a complex web of supply chain interactions. To understand the trends, the behaviour of the underlying supply chains must be understood. Using Global Positioning System (GPS) traces of commercial vehicles and network theory concepts, this paper examines the characteristics of supply chain micro communities in three urban areas in South Africa. The similarity in the structure of these micro-communities across the three, very diverse, areas suggests that the dynamics that drive supply chain interaction are not dependent on local geography. Four prominent archetypes were identified that account for more than half of the micro-communities in each area. Directionality, geographic dispersion and the balance of importance in the micro-communities are studied in the context of these archetypes. This paper presents a first puzzle piece in deducing urban freight transport patterns from supply chain interaction. Furthermore the results are an empirical benchmark that can validate theoretic models of urban supply chain interaction.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0966-6923	1873-1236		WOS:000459519800019		J	Calignano, Giuseppe; Fitjar, Rune Dahl; Hjertvikrem, Nina				Fitjar, Rune Dahl/C-2580-2013	Fitjar, Rune Dahl/0000-0001-5333-2701			Innovation networks and green restructuring: Which path development can EU Framework Programmes stimulate in Norway?

The aim is to explore the programmes' potential for supporting green economy and economic restructuring through branching and new path creation. The authors assess which regions participate in the programmes, which international networks they build, and which organisations participate in different regions. They compare three regions with different restructuring needs and research capacity - the counties of Rogaland, Hordaland, and Sor-Trondelag (now part of the county of Trondelag). They find that overall, Norwegian organisations participate relatively frequently in the programmes, but private firms play a marginal role. Their partners are mainly in core EU regions. Regional participation in the programmes is a function of research capacity as well as oil dependence. The authors conclude that in research-oriented regions, research establishments tend to dominate participation, creating potential for restructuring mainly through path creation. In oil-dependent regions, private firms account for a higher share of participants, enhancing the potential for branching. As the former regions participate more, the programme can mainly stimulate path creation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0029-1951	1502-5292		WOS:000459691200006		J	Li, Kezan; Zhu, Guanghu; Ma, Zhongjun; Chen, Lijuan								Dynamic stability of an SIQS epidemic network and its optimal control								COMMUNICATIONS IN NONLINEAR SCIENCE AND NUMERICAL SIMULATION				66				84	95		10.1016/j.cnsns.2018.06.020					JAN 2019	2019	In order to better understand and utilize the quarantine control when encountering outbreaks of infectious diseases, this paper introduces a nonlinear SIQS epidemic model on complex networks.

Moreover, we investigate the optimal quarantine control problem for reducing control cost. By applying the optimal control theory, we obtain existence and uniqueness of the optimal control and the model's optimal solution. These results are verified by some numerical examples, and the influence of network structure on the optimal control is also studied. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional link prediction methods that assume handcrafted features (such as common neighbors) as the link's formation mechanism are not universal. Other popular methods tend to learn the link's representation, but they cannot represent the link fully. In this paper, we propose Edge-Nodes Representation Neural Machine (ENRNM), a novel method which can learn abundant topological features from the network as the link's representation to promote the formation of the link. The ENRNM learns the link's formation mechanism by combining the representation of edge and the representations of nodes on the two sides of the edge as link's full representation. To predict the link's existence, we train a fully connected neural network which can learn meaningful and abundant patterns. We prove that the features of edge and two nodes have the same importance in link's formation. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on eight networks, experiment results demonstrate that the method ENRNM not only exceeds plenty of state-of-the-art link prediction methods but also performs very well on diverse networks with different structures and characteristics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1999-4893			WOS:000459725100012		J	Hua, Jie; Huang, Mao Lin; Huang, Weidong; Zhao, Chenglin								Applying Graph Centrality Metrics in Visual Analytics of Scientific Standard Datasets								SYMMETRY-BASEL				11	1					30	10.3390/sym11010030					JAN 2019	2019	Graphs are often used to model data with a relational structure and graphs are usually visualised into node-link diagrams for a better understanding of the underlying data. Node-link diagrams represent not only data entries in a graph, but also the relations among the data entries. Further, many graph drawing algorithms and graph centrality metrics have been successfully applied in visual analytics of various graph datasets, yet little attention has been paid to analytics of scientific standard data. This study attempts to adopt graph drawing methods (force-directed algorithms) to visualise scientific standard data and provide information with importance ranking' based on graph centrality metrics such as Weighted Degree, PageRank, Eigenvector, Betweenness and Closeness factors. The outcomes show that our method can produce clear graph layouts of scientific standard for visual analytics, along with the importance ranking' factors (represent via node colour, size etc.). Our method may assist users with tracking various relationships while understanding scientific standards with fewer relation issues (missing/wrong connection etc.) through focusing on higher priority standards.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2073-8994			WOS:000459739500030		J	Rodriguez Lucatero, Carlos; Alarcon Ramos, Luis Angel								Use of Enumerative Combinatorics for Proving the Applicability of an Asymptotic Stability Result on Discrete-Time SIS Epidemics in Complex Networks								MATHEMATICS				7	1					30	10.3390/math7010030					JAN 2019	2019	In this paper, we justify by the use of Enumerative Combinatorics, the applicability of an asymptotic stability result on Discrete-Time Epidemics in Complex Networks, where the complex dynamics of an epidemic model to identify the nodes that contribute the most to the propagation process are analyzed, and, because of that, are good candidates to be controlled in the network in order to stabilize the network to reach the extinction state. The epidemic model analyzed was proposed and published in 2011 by of Gomez et al. The asymptotic stability result obtained in the present article imply that it is not necessary to control all nodes, but only a minimal set of nodes if the topology of the network is not regular. This result could be important in the spirit of considering policies of isolation or quarantine of those nodes to be controlled. Simulation results using a refined version of the asymptotic stability result were presented in another paper of the second author for large free-scale and regular networks that corroborate the theoretical findings. In the present article, we justify the applicability of the controllability result obtained in the mentioned paper in almost all the cases by means of the use of Combinatorics.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2227-7390			WOS:000459734200030		J	Grando, Felipe; Granville, Lisandro Z.; Lamb, Luis C.

Centrality measures are an important analysis mechanism to uncover vital elements of complex networks. However, these metrics have high computational costs and requirements that hinder their applications in large real-world networks. In this tutorial, we explain how the use of neural network learning algorithms can render the application of the metrics in complex networks of arbitrary size. Moreover, the tutorial describes how to identify the best configuration for neural network training and learning such for tasks, besides presenting an easy way to generate and acquire training data. We do so by means of a general methodology, using complex network models adaptable to any application. We show that a regression model generated by the neural network successfully approximates the metric values and therefore is a robust, effective alternative in real-world applications. The methodology and proposed machine-learning model use only a fraction of time with respect to other approximation algorithms, which is crucial in complex network applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0360-0300	1557-7341		WOS:000457121600015		J	Zhang, Lingling; Li, Jing; Zhang, Qiuliu; Meng, Fan; Teng, Weili								Domain Knowledge-Based Link Prediction in Customer-Product Bipartite Graph for Product Recommendation								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & DECISION MAKING				18	1			311	338		10.1142/S0219622018410031					JAN 2019	2019	In this paper, we propose domain knowledge-based link prediction algorithm in customer-product bipartite network to improve effectiveness of product recommendation in retail. The domain knowledge is classified into product domain knowledge and time context knowledge, which play an important part in link prediction. We take both of them into consideration in recommendation and form a unified domain knowledge-based link prediction framework. We capture product semantic similarity by ontology-based analysis and time attenuation factor from time context knowledge, then incorporate them into network topological similarity to form a new linkage measure. To evaluate the algorithm, we use a real retail transaction dataset from Food Mart. Experimental results demonstrate that the usage of domain knowledge in link prediction achieved significantly better performance.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0219-6220	1793-6845		WOS:000457238100011		J	Sorrentino, Francesco; Siddique, Abu Bakar; Pecora, Louis M.

Several metrics have been introduced to characterize the structure of these networks, such as the degree distribution, degree correlation, path length, clustering coefficient, centrality measures, etc. Another important feature is the presence of network symmetries. In particular, the effect of these symmetries has been studied in the context of network synchronization, where they have been used to predict the emergence and stability of cluster synchronous states. Here, we provide theoretical, numerical, and experimental evidence that network symmetries play a role in a substantially broader class of dynamical models on networks, including epidemics, game theory, communication, and coupled excitable systems; namely, we see that in all these models, nodes that are related by a symmetry relation show the same time-averaged dynamical properties. This discovery leads us to propose reduction techniques for exact, yet minimal, simulation of complex networks dynamics, which we show are effective in order to optimize the use of computational resources, such as computation time and memory.

Given a specific set of nodes immune to perturbations, we find that the stability of a multilayer Boolean network is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking matrix of corresponding aggregated network. Aimed to minimize this largest eigenvalue, we developed the metric of multilayer collective influence (MCI) to quantify the impact of immunizing individual nodes on the stability of the system. Compared with other competing heuristics, immunizing nodes with high MCI scores can stabilize an unstable multilayer network with higher efficiency on both synthetic and real-world networks. Moreover, despite that coupling nodes can exert direct influence across multiple layers, they are found to exhibit less importance as measured by the MCI score. Our work reveals the mechanism of maintaining the stability of multilayer Boolean networks and provides an efficient targeted immunization strategy, which can be potentially applied to the location of pathogenesis of diseases and the development of targeted therapy.

While powerful, they suffer from the slow mixing problem when the graph is loosely connected, which results in poor estimation accuracy. Random walk with jumps (RWwJ) can address the slow mixing problem but it is inapplicable if the graph does not support uniform vertex sampling (UNI). In this work, we develop methods that can efficiently sample a graph without the necessity of UNI but still enjoy the similar benefits as RWwJ. We observe that many graphs under study, called target graphs, do not exist in isolation. In many situations, a target graph is related to an auxiliary graph and a bipartite graph, and they together form a better connected two-layered network structure. This new viewpoint brings extra benefits to graph sampling: if directly sampling a target graph is difficult, we can sample it indirectly with the assistance of the other two graphs. We propose a series of new graph sampling techniques by exploiting such a two-layered network structure to estimate target graph characteristics. Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of these new techniques.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1384-5810	1573-756X		WOS:000455608400002		J	Gu, Jiaying; Fu, Fei; Zhou, Qing								Penalized estimation of directed acyclic graphs from discrete data								STATISTICS AND COMPUTING				29	1			161	176		10.1007/s11222-018-9801-y					JAN 2019	2019	Bayesian networks, with structure given by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), are a popular class of graphical models. However, learning Bayesian networks from discrete or categorical data is particularly challenging, due to the large parameter space and the difficulty in searching for a sparse structure. In this article, we develop a maximum penalized likelihood method to tackle this problem. Instead of the commonly used multinomial distribution, we model the conditional distribution of a node given its parents by multi-logit regression, in which an edge is parameterized by a set of coefficient vectors with dummy variables encoding the levels of a node. To obtain a sparse DAG, a group norm penalty is employed, and a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm is developed to maximize the penalized likelihood subject to the acyclicity constraint of a DAG. When interventional data are available, our method constructs a causal network, in which a directed edge represents a causal relation. We apply our method to various simulated and real data sets. The results show that our method is very competitive, compared to many existing methods, in DAG estimation from both interventional and high-dimensional observational data.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0960-3174	1573-1375		WOS:000457464800011		J	Chen, Yun; Hu, Zhigen; Liu, Quan					Hu, Zhigen/0000-0002-2630-1296			EXPLORING THE PROPERTIES OF COST OVERRUN RISK PROPAGATION NETWORK (CORPN) FOR PROMOTING COST MANAGEMENT								JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT				25	1			1	18		10.3846/jcem.2019.7462					2019	2019	Construction cost overrun chronically plagues contractors. To address the issue, numerous studies have explored cost overrun risks (CORs). Nevertheless, their methods of identifying risk relationship are susceptible to experts' experience. In addition, they fail to unearth the relationship structure information and analyze the risk propagation effect. To fill these gaps, this paper intends to propose a methodology that integrates the engineering case analysis and complex network theory, so as to obtain a stable relationship structure and reveal its inherent property. First, 52 CORs and 158 risk paths are extracted from 156 engineering cases, followed by the establishment of a cost overrun risk propagation network (CORPN). Finally, the statistical properties of CORPN are explored. The results indicate that CORPN presents the topological property of heterogeneity. A large number of risk paths can be blocked through preventing the CORs with large total degree, like delay in construction period and engineering quantity increase. Meanwhile, CORPN shows the small-world property. The efficiency of risk propagation can be reduced through preventing the CORs with high betweenness centrality, such as lack of technical skill and experience. These findings contribute to the formulation of beforehand strategies that promote the cost management.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1392-3730	1822-3605		WOS:000457736700001		J	Zischg, Jonatan; Klinkhamer, Christopher; Zhan, Xianyuan; Rao, P.

We applied network analyses to a unique time-stamped network data set of an Alpine case study, representing the historical development of the town and its infrastructure over the past 108 years. The analyzed infrastructure includes the water distribution network (WDN), the urban drainage network (UDN), and the road network (RN). We use the dual representation of the network by using the Hierarchical Intersection Continuity Negotiation (HICN) approach, with pipes or roads as nodes and their intersections as edges. The functional topologies of the networks are analyzed based on the dual graphs, providing insights beyond a conventional graph (primal mapping) analysis. We observe that the RN, WDN, and UDN all exhibit heavy tailed node degree distributions with high dispersion around the mean. In 50 percent of the investigated networks, an be approximated with truncated [Pareto] power-law functions, as they are known for scale-free networks. Structural differences between the three evolving network types resulting from different functionalities and system states are reflected in the and other complex network metrics. Small-world tendencies are identified by comparing the networks with their random and regular lattice network equivalents. Furthermore, we show the remapping of the dual network characteristics to the spatial map and the identification of criticalities among different network types through co-location analysis and discuss possibilities for further applications.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526		WOS:000456572800001		J	Li, Ming-Xia; Zhou, Wei-Xing; Stanley, H.

Most studies on the transfer of football players focus on the transfer system and transfer fees but not on the transfer behavior itself. Based on the 470792 transfer records from 1990 to 2016 among 2:3765 football clubs in 206 countries and regions, we construct a directed footballer transfer network (FTN), where the nodes are the football clubs and the links correspond to the footballer transfers. A systemic analysis is conduced on the topological properties of the FTN. We find that the in-degrees, out-degrees, in-strengths and out-strengths of nodes follow bimodal distributions (a power law with exponential decay), while the distribution of link weights has a power-law tail. We further figure out the correlations between node degrees, node strengths and link weights. We also investigate the general characteristics of different measures of network centrality. Our network analysis of the global footballer transfer market sheds new lights into the investigation of the characteristics of transfer activities.

The couplings inside nodes are assumed to be nonlinear and subject to multiple time-varying delays. Meanwhile, the connection topology among the nodes can be directed and weighted. Then, the adaptive aperiodically intermittent control method is employed to realize synchronization and automatic modification to compensate the changes in dynamic errors. In addition, several synchronization criteria are rigorously induced based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the proposed control method is evaluated by utilizing numerical simulation.

The advent of online social networks (OSNs), which store data about interactions between billions of people, has greatly alleviated this problem. Since user interaction on the OSNs can correspond to their real-life relationships, OSN datasets quickly became a highly sought-after resource for social network research. However, enabling open access to such data entails serious security and privacy risks, especially after the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation. Some researchers mitigate this problem through anonymization, while others argue for the creation of synthetic datasets. We consider synthetic datasets preferable since they circumvent the security and privacy issues. Existing synthetic dataset generators produce a social graph containing only information whether a pair of nodes are connected. However, interpersonal relationships are much more complex. Because of that, our research considers the possibility of generating a synthetic expanded social graph which, in addition to the information about the existence of a connection between a pair of users, also provides information about the types and intensities of users' interactions. As Facebook is the leading OSN today, we performed an extensive analysis of Facebook users' interaction records with the aim of getting an insight into real-life interaction patterns. In this paper, we present results of this analysis at ego-user level and offer the conceptual solution for synthetic expanded social graph generation, which uses conducted analysis results as its basis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2169-3536			WOS:000456773600001		J	Tu, Haicheng; Xia, Yongxiang; Iu, Herbert Ho-Ching; Chen, Xi				Xia, Yongxiang/D-2439-2015				Optimal Robustness in Power Grids From a Network Science Perspective								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS II-EXPRESS BRIEFS				66	1			126	130		10.1109/TCSII.2018.2832850					JAN 2019	2019	In recent years, the frequent occurrences of large-scale blackouts highlight the necessity of enhancing the robustness of power grids. In this brief, based on the cascading failure model which considers both the network topology and electrical characteristics running in power grids, we study how the topological metrics affect the robustness of power grids. The topological metrics considered include both the connectivity of the network and the distribution of generators. We compare the results in typical complex network models and an IEEE 118-bus network. Moreover, by using the simulated annealing method, we find the optimal network topology to achieve the best network robustness, and compare the topological metrics before and after the optimization to verify our findings. The results show that, in order to enhance the robustness of power grids, it is better to make the network sparsely connected, and place the generators as hubs and decentralize these generators.									5	0	0	0	0	5			1549-7747	1558-3791		WOS:000454341300026		J	Schweitzer, Eran; Scaglione, Anna								A Mathematical Programming Solution for Automatic Generation of Synthetic Power Flow Cases								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER SYSTEMS				34	1			729	741		10.1109/TPWRS.2018.2863266					JAN 2019	2019	A shortage of large power system data sets, as well as the frequent restrictions on sharing such models, have led to newfound interest in creating synthetic data that can be easily shared among researchers. This paper considers the problem of forming a power system test case from the constituent parts of realistic power grid samples. Starting from a topology, and samples of generation, load, and branches, we assemble systems while respecting the constraints imposed by a typical Optimal Power Flow problem. Expressed in this manner, the problem involves solving for permutations of the input data. Since permutations matrices are binary, the problem is linearized, allowing for a Mixed Integer Linear Problem formulation. The problem is further decomposed using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers as well as an Evolutionary Algorithm to facilitate scaling to larger system sizes. A post processing step is used to add shunt elements for reactive power planning. The resulting systems demonstrate statistically similar power flow behavior to reference systems. Finally, new analysis avenues, opened by synthesizing test cases according to the proposed method, are briefly introduced by creating fictitious systems with different topology models and examining how these affect power flow behavior.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0885-8950	1558-0679		WOS:000454252800067		J	Huang, Jinyu; Jin, Xiaogang					Huang, Jinyu/0000-0001-8237-6324			Opinion formation on evolving and adaptive networks								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										013202	10.1088/1742-5468/aaf320					JAN 2019	2019	Members in a social group may change over time: a new member is recruited; a current member stops his or her position; a candidate supersedes a member of the group. Here we investigate the effects of changes of nodes on the dynamics of opinion formation. In our model, opinion formation is in two stages. In the first stage, a network evolves through a voting process that is used to select agents to add into the network, to remove from the network or to be replaced by other agents. Special rules for the voting process are necessary in the first stage. We focus on two rules, namely, majority rule and random rule. In the second stage, opinion formation takes place. We find that the majority rule generally foster consensus formation in comparison to the random rule. We also investigate the effects of changes of agents on two-party systems, in which there are two parties and opinions of members in the same party are close to each other. In particular, the effects of diversity of opinions for two-party systems are studied. A counterintuitive finding is that the diversity of opinions, instead of hindering consensus formation, facilitates consensus formation.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000455054100002		J	Ma, Xiaojian; Ma, Yinghong					Ma, yinghong/0000-0002-1703-3330			The Local Triangle Structure Centrality Method to Rank Nodes in Networks								COMPLEXITY										9057194	10.1155/2019/9057194					2019	2019	Detecting influential spreaders had become a challenging and crucial topic so far due to its practical application in many areas, such as information propagation inhibition and disease dissemination control. Some traditional local based evaluation methods had given many discussions on ranking important nodes. In this paper, ranking nodes of networks continues to be discussed. A semilocal structures method for ranking nodes based on the degree and the neighbors' connections of the node is presented. The semilocal structures are regarded as the number of neighbors of the nodes and the connections between the node and its neighbors. We combined the triangle structure and the degree information of the neighbors to define the inner-outer spreading ability of the nodes and then summed the node neighbors' inner-outer spreading ability to be used as the local triangle structure centrality (LTSC). The LTSC avoids the defect pseudo denser connections in measuring the structure of neighbors. The performance of the proposed LTSC method is evaluated by comparing the spreading ability on both real-world and synthetic networks with the SIR model. The simulation results of the discriminability and the correctness compared with pairs of ranks (one is generated by SIR model and the others are generated by central nodes measures) show that LTSC outperforms some other local or semilocal methods in evaluating the node's influence in most cases, such as degree, betweenness, H-index, local centrality, local structure centrality, K-shell, and S-shell. The experiments prove that the LTSC is an efficient and accurate ranking method which provides a more reasonable evaluating index to rank nodes than some previous approaches.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1076-2787	1099-0526		WOS:000455753900001		J	Kim, Joohyun; Kwon, Ohsung; Lee, Duk Hee					Kwon, Ohsung/0000-0002-0968-1215			Observing Cascade Behavior Depending on the Network Topology and Transaction Costs								COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				53	1			207	225		10.1007/s10614-017-9738-9					JAN 2019	2019	The Internet, smartphones, Social Networking Service, and other IT goods have improved the overall quality of life, but created an over-connectedness with extremely low transaction costs in our society, amplifying latent social problems. In light of this, we demonstrate the main mechanism of information cascades in various network topologies using computational model that can consider autonomous agents, the adoption of others' decisions, and network topologies. Our findings reveal that: (1) lower transaction costs may amplify the occurrence of information cascades; (2) the network structure significantly affects the behavior of traders in terms of the individual and the whole market; and (3) highly spread trend-shift cascades can be observed in scale-free networks when the influence of a dominant agent's decision significantly affects the connected agents. Such findings highlight how a highly over-connected network has its critical shortcomings.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0927-7099	1572-9974		WOS:000455498900010		J	Chen, Xingguang; Zhu, Zhentao								Interactional Effects Between Individual Heterogeneity and Collective Behavior in Complex Organizational Systems								COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				53	1			289	313		10.1007/s10614-017-9731-3					JAN 2019	2019	Academics and practical practitioners increasingly recognize the complexity between individuals features,organizational structure and collective behavior. Yet research examining the effects between these elements remains fragmented and scarce. The purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between the components of individuals features and organizational behavior, with special focus on multi-hierarchy systems. A straightforward and comprehensive model named dynamic object interaction model is proposed to address these complex relations based on the idea of near decomposability. Computational simulation experiment shows that individual features have different impacts on the macro collective behavior. If the organizational members's behavior are stable and its type will not change, then homogeneous networks can alleviate the fluctuation of organizational output better than heterogeneous networks, while this results are not stand in unstable members context. In contrast, if the organizational members's type is varying constantly, then for specific networks structure, mixed type staff composition will be more beneficial for convergence of the organizational output than single type staff composition. Furthermore, optimal convergence interval of members is uncovered under dynamic context,there exist statistical significance between four typical organizational network models.Accordingly, the underlying mechanism are discussed to promote understanding for effective organizational redesign and managerial decision.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0927-7099	1572-9974		WOS:000455498900013		J	Berry, George; Cameron, Christopher J.; Park, Patrick; Macy, Michael								The opacity problem in social contagion								SOCIAL NETWORKS				56				93	101		10.1016/j.socnet.2018.09.001					JAN 2019	2019	Many social phenomena can be modeled as cascades in networks, where nodes adopt a behavior in response to peers adopting. When studying cascades, researchers typically assume that the number of active peers when a node adopts is equivalent to the node's threshold for adoption. This assumption is rarely justified due to the "opacity problem": networked cascades reveal intervals which contain thresholds, rather than point estimates. Existing approaches take the maximum of each node's threshold interval, which biases models of social influence. Opacity is inevitable in many small graphs when using the threshold model, resulting from the networked process itself rather than data collection techniques. Using simulation, we extend this finding to the probabilistic SI (independent cascade) model. We confirm these theoretical results by studying 50 large hashtag cascades among 3.2 million Twitter users, finding that 20% of adoptions suffer from opacity. Different assumptions in response to opacity qualitatively change conclusions about peer influence. While opacity is a far-reaching problem, it can be addressed. Using information from nodes who have tightly bounded intervals allows building models to reduce error in estimating node thresholds.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-8733	1879-2111		WOS:000454966400009		J	Robertson, Duncan A.								Spatial Transmission Models: A Taxonomy and Framework								RISK ANALYSIS				39	1	SI		225	243		10.1111/risa.13142					JAN 2019	2019	Within risk analysis and, more broadly, the decision behind the choice of which modeling technique to use to study the spread of disease, epidemics, fires, technology, rumors, or, more generally, spatial dynamics, is not well documented. While individual models are well defined and the modeling techniques are well understood by practitioners, there is little deliberate choice made as to the type of model to be used, with modelers using techniques that are well accepted in the field, sometimes with little thought as to whether alternative modeling techniques could or should be used. In this article, we divide modeling techniques for spatial transmission into four main categories: population-level models, where a macro-level estimate of the infected population is required; cellular models, where the transmission takes place between connected domains, but is restricted to a fixed topology of neighboring cells; network models, where host-to-host transmission routes are modeled, either as planar spatial graphs or where shortcuts can take place as in social networks; and, finally, agent-based models that model the local transmission between agents, either as host-to-host geographical contacts, or by modeling the movement of the disease vector, with dynamic movement of hosts and vectors possible, on a Euclidian space or a more complex space deformed by the existence of information about the topology of the landscape. We summarize these techniques by introducing a taxonomy classifying these modeling approaches. Finally, we present a framework for choosing the most appropriate spatial modeling method, highlighting the links between seemingly disparate methodologies, bearing in mind that the choice of technique rests with the subject expert.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0272-4332	1539-6924		WOS:000454958400015	30144107	J	Matta, Vincenzo; Sayed, Ali H.

Agent i influences agent j if they are connected (according to the network topology), and if agent j uses the data from agent i to update its online learning algorithm. The solution of this inference task is challenging for two main reasons. First, only the output of the learning algorithm is available to the external observer that must perform the inference based on these indirect measurements. Second, only output measurements from a fraction of the network agents is available, with the total number of agents itself being also unknown. The main focus of this paper is ascertaining under these demanding conditions whether consistent tomography is possible, namely, whether it is possible to reconstruct the interaction profile of the observable portion of the network, with negligible error as the network size increases. We establish a critical achievability result, namely, that for symmetric combination policies and for any given fraction of observable agents, the interacting and non-interacting agent pairs split into two separate clusters as the network size increases. This remarkable property then enables the application of clustering algorithms to identify the interacting agents influencing the observations. We provide a set of numerical experiments that verify the results for finite network sizes and time horizons. The numerical experiments show that the results hold for asymmetric combination policies as well, which is particularly relevant in the context of causation.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0018-9448	1557-9654		WOS:000454110800041		J	Lu, Zhuo; Sagduyu, Yalin E.; Shi, Yi								Integrating Social Links into Wireless Networks: Modeling, Routing, Analysis, and Evaluation								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING				18	1			111	124		10.1109/TMC.2018.2827985					JAN 2019	2019	Social connections among network nodes have been well investigated as an additional opportunity in network design (e.g., in routing strategies and trusted networking). This paper presents a paradigm shift that explores the design and performance analysis of combining social links jointly with communication links for message delivery in wireless networks. In a combined multi-layer social and communication network, communication links are based on conventional wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth) and social links are overlaid over a communication infrastructure (e.g., cellular network) that provides an alternative way for data transmission. The goal is to characterize the performance analytically when routing is designed by combining social and communication links. A distance discretization technique is applied to model the reliability and delay of message delivery. The analytical foundation is developed to analyze the end-to-end delay and success probability under various effects of persistent transmission, potential error in distance estimation, and mobility Systematic routing strategies that employ network inference are then designed to improve the performance in different aspects, such as delivery delay, delivery success probability, and energy-saving. A network emulation testbed is implemented with actual radios and real-world social network datasets to measure the performance of a heterogeneous network with social and communication links. The results in this paper show that the integration of social links in wireless network routing as a multi-layer design leads to substantial performance improvement for delay and reliability of message delivery.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1536-1233	1558-0660		WOS:000452441000009		J	Rubineau, Brian; Lim, Yisook; Neblo, Michael								Low status rejection: How status hierarchies influence negative tie formation								SOCIAL NETWORKS				56				33	44		10.1016/j.socnet.2018.08.005					JAN 2019	2019	Scholarship investigating how social status patterns negative ties has yielded contradictory findings. Three likely sources for these differences are: different measures of social status, measures of negative ties (perceived versus dyadic), and structural factors. This study uses multiple measures of social status, sociometrically-measured negative ties, and multiple analytic approaches - MRQAP to control for structure and within-individual to control for heterogeneity - to help resolve this debate. We find: negative ties travel down status hierarchies and target low status individuals, and a negative tie between two people becomes more likely as their status difference increases. These results suggest a low-status rejection mechanism.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0378-8733	1879-2111		WOS:000454966400004		J	Hu, Xiao-Bing; Li, Hang; Guo, XiaoMei; van Gelder, Pieter H. A. J.

To qualitatively and quantitatively assess the impact of spatially local hazards on network systems, this article develops a new spatial vulnerability model by taking into account hazard location, area covered by hazard, and impact of hazard (including direct impact and indirect impact), and proposes an absolute spatial vulnerability index (ASVI) and a relative spatial vulnerability index (RSVI). The relationship between the new model and some relevant traditional network properties is also analyzed. A case study on the spatial vulnerability of the Chinese civil aviation network system is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model, and another case study on the Beijing subway network system to verify its relationship with traditional network properties.									1	0	0	0	0	1			0272-4332	1539-6924		WOS:000454958400011	29570836	J	Saucan, Emil; Sreejith, R.

In this direction, we have recently introduced Forman's discretization of Ricci curvature to the realm of undirected networks. Investigation of this edge-centric network measure, Forman-Ricci curvature, in diverse model and real-world undirected networks revealed that the curvature measure captures several aspects of the organization of undirected complex networks. However, many important real-world networks are inherently directed in nature, and the definition of the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected networks is unsuitable for the analysis of such directed networks. Hence, we here extend the Forman-Ricci curvature for undirected networks to the case of directed networks. The simple mathematical formula for the Forman-Ricci curvature of a directed edge elegantly incorporates vertex weights, edge weights and edge direction. Furthermore we have compared the Forman-Ricci curvature with the adaptation to directed networks of another discrete notion of Ricci curvature, namely, the well established Ollivier-Ricci curvature. However, the two above-mentioned curvature measures do not account for higher-order correlations between vertices. To this end, we adjusted Forman's original definition of Ricci curvature to account for directed simplicial complexes and also explored the potential of this new, augmented type of Forman-Ricci curvature, in directed complex networks.

To evaluate the water-related impacts of energy-related decisions, we built a national energy water nexus scenario analysis assessment framework by extending input output analysis (IOA) to future energy mix scenarios of China. The scenarios for China out to 2050 include four low-carbon-development scenarios that are planned in climate change mitigation roadmaps and one baseline scenario. Sectoral direct energy, direct water, water-related energy, and energy-related water consumption were inventoried. Sectoral embodied consumption of water and energy and their inter-sector flows were mapped using IOA to create energy water nexus networks. A sectoral nexus was defined to investigate the impact of the energy water linkage on energy and water systems. Sectoral control and dependence relationships were revealed by ecological network analysis. Results showed that nexus impact on the water system was larger than that on the energy system. The main export and import pairs-Chemical industry-Agriculture (Ag), Manufacturing-Ag, Ag Metal smelting and pressing (Me), and Me-Electricity (El) should be critical pathways for nexus management via the adjustment of sectoral economic relationships. The sectors with a high nexus impact-Ag, El, and Me-should decrease their energy and water consumption to achieve outsized system-wide savings. Sectors with a low nexus impact such as domestic services; transport, storage and post services; and water production and supply-can increase their energy and water consumption with a lesser impact on the wider system. The low-carbon-development scenario exhibited the lowest nexus impact, followed by the enhanced low-carbon scenario, whose energy mix also exerted the lowest pressure on the water system. By analyzing the tradeoffs between energy, water, and carbon emissions under five scenarios, this study provides insights for nexus management on how to balance water shortage issues and the development of energy generation in future energy and water resource planning.									2	0	0	0	0	2			0306-2619	1872-9118		WOS:000454376900064		J	Armando Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo				Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando/F-9512-2014	Ronda-Pupo, Guillermo Armando/0000-0002-9049-8249			The scaling relationship between degree centrality and citation-based impact of articles on strategic management								E-CIENCIAS DE LA INFORMACION				9	1						10.15517/eci.v1i1.34168					JAN-JUN 2019	2019	The aim of this study is to explore the scaling relationship between degree centrality and citation-based performance of countries articles on Strategic Management.

Due to a reinforcement mechanism and interaction, the walks are strongly correlated and converge almost surely to the same, possibly random, limit. We study random walks interacting through a mean-field rule and compare the rate they converge to their limit with the rate of synchronization, i.e. the rate at which their mutual distances converge to zero. We show that, under certain conditions, synchronization is faster than convergence. Even if our focus is on theoretical results, we propose as main motivations two contexts in which such results could directly apply: urn models and opinion dynamics in a random network evolving via preferential attachment.

Recently, it has been shown experimentally that the altruistic punishment of defectors where punishments bring no material gain for punisher is a key motive for the explanation of cooperation. Here we study how punishment and cooperation among the subjects of a system affect the growth of the entire system where we propose an evolution mechanism by merging scale-free growth and game theory. The subjects cooperate, defect and altruistically punish each other, where the increase of the level of punishment makes the system more cooperative. We derive under which conditions the system grows, what is the speed of growth, and for which condition the system can even collapse. For a set of countries we analyse how depending on the level of corruption a country punishes those who brake the traffic rule. We perform a survey to identify what should be a punishment for those who ride without the ticket in public transportation.

In each iteration of the search in such algorithms, every agent selects a group of agents that comply with some selection criteria (each algorithm specifies different criteria). Then, the agent who selected the group, called the mediator, collects assignment information from the group and neighboring agents outside the group, in order to find an optimal set of assignments for its group's agents. A contest between mediators of adjacent groups determines which groups will replace their assignments in that iteration to the found optimal ones. In this work we present a framework called RODA (Region Optimal DCOP Algorithm) that encompasses the algorithms in the region optimality family, and in particular any method for selecting groups. We devise a secure implementation of RODA, called P-RODA, which preserves constraint privacy and partial decision privacy. Our discussion covers both symmetric and asymmetric DCOPs. The two main cryptographic means that enable this privacy preservation are secret sharing and homomorphic encryption. We estimate the computational overhead of P-RODA with respect to RODA and give an upper bound that depends on the group and domain sizes and on the graph topology, but not on the number of agents. The estimations are substantiated with experimental results, including experiments on a simulator, that compare the performance of P-RODA to that of its competing algorithm, P-Max-Sum.

However, there were few fundamental explanations of why and how the stochastic approach reduces systematic errors. We discuss how to non-locally optimize stochastic retrievals and to alleviate nonlinear error propagations of the deterministic Soil moisture ocean salinity (SMOS) soil moisture retrievals. By near-zero maximal Lyapunov exponents and rank probability skill score, the retrieval ensembles are optimized for bias correction in a computationally effective way. It is found that the diverse ensembles achieve better representativeness and structural stability than the ensembles from the majority. This stochastic property is important for effective bias correction. It is suggested that this stochastic approach independently resolves SMOS dry biases without relying on a local standard of root mean square errors from the field measurements or a relative comparison with reference data. Due to flexibility and non-determinism of surface heterogeneity this approach has a potential as a global frame.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000452898500042		J	Jardine, Eric								The trouble with (supply-side) counts: the potential and limitations of counting sites, vendors or products as a metric for threat trends on the Dark Web								INTELLIGENCE AND NATIONAL SECURITY				34	1			95	111		10.1080/02684527.2018.1528752					2019	2019	Many national security threats now originate on the Dark Web. As a result of the anonymity of these networks, researchers and policymakers often use supply-side data (i.e. the number of sites) as a threat metric. However, the utility of these data depends upon the underlying distribution of users. Users could be distributed uniformly, normally or in a power law across Dark Web content. The utility of supply-side counts varies predictably based upon the underlying distribution of users. Yet, the likelihood of each distribution type varies inversely with its utility: uniform distributions are most useful for intelligence purposes but least likely and power law distributions are least useful but occur most commonly. Complementing supply-side counts with demand-side measures can improve Dark Web threat analysis, thereby helping to combat terrorism, criminality and cyberattacks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0268-4527	1743-9019		WOS:000451748500006		J	Chakraborty, Abhijit; Krichene, Hazem; Inoue, Hiroyasu; Fujiwara, Yoshi								Characterization of the community structure in a large-scale production network in Japan								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				513				210	221		10.1016/j.physa.2018.08.175					JAN 1 2019	2019	Inter-firm organizations, which play a driving role in the economy of a country, can be represented in the form of a customer-supplier network. Such a network exhibits a heavy-tailed degree distribution, disassortative mixing and a prominent community structure. We analyze a large-scale data set of customer-supplier relationships containing data from one million Japanese firms. Using a directed network framework, we show that the production network exhibits the characteristics listed above. We conduct detailed investigations to characterize the communities in the network. The topology within smaller communities is found to be very close to a tree-like structure but becomes denser as the community size increases. A large fraction (similar to 40%) of firms with relatively small in- or out-degrees have customers or suppliers solely from within their own communities, indicating interactions of a highly local nature. The interaction strengths between communities as measured by the inter-community link weights follow a highly heterogeneous distribution. We further present the statistically significant over-expressions of different prefectures and sectors within different communities. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent research has shown that the time-balanced variant of the popular Google's PageRank and degree for identifying significant works could provide an objective approach to eliminate the age preference in growing networks. However, a fundamental question remains open: How much performance capability do time-balanced metrics expect when they identify significant nodes in the growing networks? Through investigating of two large time-aggregated citations networks between movies procured from the Internet Movie Database and papers published on the journals of American Physical Society respectively, we analyze the age preference of several time-balanced metrics of PageRank and degree for identifying significant nodes in comparison.

Under two node-based strategy updating rules, strategy updating occurs between a randomly chosen focal node and its randomly selected neighbour. The focal agent becomes the strategy recipient and may imitate the strategy of the neighbour according to the payoff difference, i.e. voter-model-like dynamics (VMLD), or becomes a strategy donor and thus may be imitated by the neighbour, i.e. invasion-process-like dynamics (IPLD). For edge-based updating rules, one edge is selected, and the roles of the two connected nodes (donor or recipient) are randomly decided, i.e. edge-based dynamics (EBD). A computer simulation shows that partner switching supports the evolution of cooperation under VMLD, which has been utilised in many studies on spatial evolutionary games, whereas cooperators often vanish under IPLD. The EBD results lie between these two processes. This difference is prominent among nodes with large degrees. In addition, partner switching induces a non-monotonic relationship between the fraction of cooperators and intensity of selection under VMLD and EBD, and a weak or strong selection supports cooperation. In contrast, only a strong selection supports cooperators under IPLD. Similar differences in the enhancement of cooperation are observed when games are played on static heterogeneous networks. Our results imply that the direction of imitation is quite important for understanding the evolutionary process of cooperation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the spatial information of components may be a key factor influencing the invulnerability of actual networks. For interdependent infrastructures, considering space constraints, dependency links may be established locally, where only nodes within certain connection radius r connect can be connected as dependent node pairs. Therefore, based on the topology-based cascading failure model, the invulnerability of interdependent scale-free networks is studied by introducing five coupling patterns in this paper, including global and local random couplings GR and LR, global and local degree-degree inter-similarity couplings GD and LD and nearest neighbor coupling NN. Under topological attacks, the inter-similarity couplings GD and LD have better performance, and as r connect increases, the effect of LD will gradually approach to GD. In order to ensure a good invulnerability and low construction cost, a novel hybrid coupling pattern of NN and LD is proposed. With numerical simulations, we find that selecting nodes with large degree to establish LD coupling has significant effect, and there is an optimal selection fraction. Under localized attacks, the local couplings perform better, and LD is better for small r connect while NN is better for large r connect. In addition, we also study a simplified localized attacking strategy analytically based on percolation theory, which is proved to be consistent with the numerical results. For LD coupling, the effect will be influenced by r connect, and there are minimum and maximum invulnerability values for topological and localized attacks, respectively. These findings can help to understand the characteristics of spatially embedded interdependent infrastructures. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Many efforts have been made to detect manipulation in stock market. However, with the development of technology, the means of manipulation become more and more diversified and the effective detection methods remain to be an open problem. Here, we develop a generalized method for colluded traders detection based on transaction data. We investigate the clique of trading network, and find the number and weight of clique are greater in manipulated stocks than that in non-manipulated stocks. We further propose a method to detect colluded traders based on weight of cliques. Results demonstrate that our method is effective at distinguishing the manipulated stocks and the colluded traders.

When the number of agents is a constant, we find that a higher risk aversion coefficient, a lower information uncertainty, or a higher standard variance of payoff volatility induces a lower asset price; a higher number of agents induces a higher aggregate demand. When the number of agents tends to infinity, we study and simulate the closed form expressions for asset price with risk aversion coefficient. We find that a higher network connectedness or a lower risk aversion coefficient induces a higher information driven volatility component and a lower Sharpe ratio; a higher network connectedness or a lower risk aversion coefficient induces a higher market efficiency. Liquidity driven volatility component, trading profit, price volatility are non-monotonic functions of network connectedness, or risk aversion coefficient. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Using an adiabatic approximation we reduced the system dynamics to a Markov chain with aggregated variables and derived a transport equation that is analogous to Fick's First Law and includes a driving force. Entropy production is a sum of microscopic entropy transport, which results from the particle's migration between networks of different topologies and macroscopic entropy production of the Markov chain. Equilibrium particles partition between different sub-networks depends only on internal sub-network parameters. By changing structure of networks one can not only modify diffusion constants but can also induce or reverse the direction of the particles' flow between different networks. Our framework, confirmed by numerical simulations, is also useful for considering diffusion in nested systems corresponding to hierarchical networks with several different time scales thus it can serve to uncover hidden hierarchy levels from observations of diffusion processes.

Connections between airports define airport networks, where nodes are cities served by airports, connected by edges if there is at least one direct flight connecting them. The aims of this research are to relate structural properties of airport networks which explain how these networks respond to isolation of critical nodes, and to gain insight into relevant socio-economic factors that influence the development of airport networks. We split the world airport network (WAN) into seven global region airport networks (GRANS), using the divisions established by OAG database. We gather information about structural properties of each GRAN determining core cities through k-core decomposition, and critical cities through robustness analysis. We find that differences of robustness across GRANS can be explained by the fraction of core cities relative to total cities. Furthermore, analysis of multilevel structure reveal relevant differences between GRANS, rooted on geographical and socio-economic factors, and give insight about how network robustness in airport networks can be enhanced.

In order to analyze the review mechanism, we propose a Naive-Evangelical-Agnostic (VEA) knowledge transmission model in complex networks. Specifically, we derive a knowledge transmission system in homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, respectively. Mean field theory is used to theoretically delineate the knowledge transmission systems. In homogeneous networks, the steady state solution of the system is obtained. In heterogeneous networks, we get the basic reproduction number R-0, in which the reviewing rate is an important parameter. Moreover, we analyze the system and prove that if R-0 < 1, the knowledge loss equilibrium of the model is globally asymptotically stable; if R-0 > 1, the knowledge is permanent. In addition, to complement the theoretical analysis, numerical simulations are performed in four representative network models: random regular, small world, random growth and scale free networks. The simulation results indicate that the review mechanism has a clear positive influence for the knowledge transmission in the four networks, i.e., a higher reviewing rate leads to a higher final density of evangelical nodes. In addition, the simulation results illustrate that scale free networks transfer knowledge faster than the other three networks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The model uses the selection of safety factors to describe the risk of rumors selection strategies, and introduces the conversion factor. The research shows that there exists a critical value of the selection safety factor in the network, and the speed of rumor propagation is small, then large, then smaller, and finally approaches zero. The study also found that the decision by both the conversion factor to choose the time factor and the conversion factor for both the rumor spreading effect, the greater the time conversion factor, the greater the rate of rumors; the greater the rate of self-selection rumor, the greater the spread of rumors, and the greater the rhythm of the rumors.

In many real-life scenarios, however, the adding of new nodes and edges is not an exogenous process, but involves inheritance and sharing of the local environment of the existing ones. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework to analytically and numerically study the percolation properties of the random networks with proliferation. We compare random attack (RA) and localized attack (LA) on benchmark models, including Erdos-Renyi (ER) networks, random regular (RR) networks, and scale-free (SF) networks, with proliferation mechanism. Our results highlight the nonmonotonic connections with robustness and growth, and unravel an intriguing opposite effect for RA and LA. In particular, it is shown that unbalanced proliferation enhances robustness to RA while it mitigates robustness to LA, both independent of the network degree distribution.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000457239100008		J	Cerqueti, Roy; Ferraro, Giovanna; Iovanella, Antonio				Iovanella, Antonio/J-9233-2012	Iovanella, Antonio/0000-0001-8147-3747; CERQUETI, ROY/0000-0002-1871-7371			A new measure for community structures through indirect social connections								EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				114				196	209		10.1016/j.eswa.2018.07.040					DEC 30 2018	2018	Based on an expert systems approach, the issue of community detection can be conceptualized as a clustering model for networks. Building upon this further, community structure can be measured through a clustering coefficient, which is generated from the number of existing triangles around the nodes over the number of triangles that can be hypothetically constructed. This paper provides a new definition of the clustering coefficient for weighted networks under a generalized definition of triangles. Specifically, a novel concept of triangles is introduced, based on the assumption that, should the aggregate weight of two arcs be strong enough, a link between the uncommon nodes can be induced. Beyond the intuitive meaning of such generalized triangles in the social context, we also explore the usefulness of them for gaining insights into the topological structure of the underlying network. Empirical experiments on the standard networks of 500 commercial US airports and on the nervous system of the Caenorhabditis elegans support the theoretical framework and allow a comparison between our proposal and the standard definition of clustering coefficient.

Associated research is focused on information propagation models, campaign initialization strategies and factors affecting campaign dynamics. In terms of algorithms and performance evaluation, the final coverage represented by the fraction of activated nodes within a target network is usually used. It is not necessarily consistent with the real marketing campaigns using various characteristics and parameters related to coverage, costs, behavioral patterns and time factors for overall evaluation. This paper presents assumptions for a decision support system for multi-criteria campaign planning and evaluation with inputs from agent-based simulations. The results, which are delivered from a simulation model based on synthetic networks in a form of decision scenarios, are verified within a real network. Last, but not least, the study proposes a multi-objective campaign evaluation framework with several campaign evaluation metrics integrated. The results showed that the recommendations generated with the use of synthetic networks applied to real networks delivered results according to the decision makers' expectation in terms of the used evaluation criteria. Apart from practical applications, the proposed multi-objective approach creates new evaluation possibilities for theoretical studies focused on information spreading processes within complex networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1932-6203			WOS:000454418200021	30589859	J	Glos, Adam; Wong, Thomas G.

In this paper, we analytically prove sufficient conditions under which such Kronecker graphs can be searched by a continuous-time quantum walk in optimal Theta(root N) time. First, if the initiator is regular and its adjacency matrix has a dominant principal eigenvalue, meaning its unique largest eigenvalue asymptotically dominates the other eigenvalues in magnitude, then the Kronecker graphs generated by this initiator can be quantum searched with probability 1 in pi root N/2 time, asymptotically, and we give the critical jumping rate of the walk that enables this. Second, for any fixed initiator that is regular, nonbipartite, and connected, the Kronecker graphs generated by it are quantum searched in Theta(root N) time. This greatly extends the number of Kronecker graphs on which quantum walks are known to optimally search. If the fixed, regular, connected initiator is bipartite, however, then search on its Kronecker powers is not optimal, but is still better than a classical computer's O (N) runtime if the initiator has more than two vertices.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2469-9926	2469-9934		WOS:000454419900003		J	Bapat, Aniruddha; Eldredge, Zachary; Garrison, James R.; Deshpande, Abhinav; Chong, Frederic T.; Gorshkov, Alexey V.

In this work we examine the impact of different graph structures on the preparation of entangled states. We begin by explaining a formal framework, the hierarchical product, in which modular graphs can be easily constructed. This framework naturally leads us to suggest a class of graphs, which we dub hierarchies. We argue that such graphs have favorable properties for quantum information processing, such as a small diameter and small total edge weight, and use the concept of Pareto efficiency to identify promising quantum graph architectures. We present numerical and analytical results on the speed at which large entangled states can be created on nearest-neighbor grids and hierarchy graphs. We also present a scheme for performing circuit placement-the translation from circuit diagrams to machine qubits-on quantum systems whose connectivity is described by hierarchies.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2469-9926	2469-9934		WOS:000454419500004		J	Newman, M.

More often the data only specify the network structure imperfectly: Like data in essentially every other area of empirical science, network data are prone to measurement error and noise. At the same time, the data may be richer than simple network measurements, incorporating multiple measurements, weights, lengths, or strengths of edges, node or edge labels, or annotations of various kinds. Here we develop a general method for making estimates of network structure and properties using any form of network data, simple or complex, when the data are unreliable, and give example applications to a selection of social and biological networks.									2	0	0	2	0	2			2470-0045	2470-0053		WOS:000454428800011		J	Ching, Emily S.

Many current methods require the measurements of the dynamics of all the nodes to be known. In real-world problems, it is common that either some nodes of a network of interest are unknown or the measurements of some nodes are unavailable. These nodes, either unknown or whose measurements are unavailable, are called hidden nodes. In this paper, we derive analytical results that explain the effects of hidden nodes on the reconstruction of bidirectional networks.

Using data from 11 culturally diverse population-scale networks on four continents encompassing 56 million Twitter users and 58 million mobile phone subscribers we find that long-range ties are nearly as strong as social ties embedded within a small circle of friends. These high-bandwidth connections have important implications for diffusion and social integration.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0036-8075	1095-9203		WOS:000453845000061	30573627	J	Liu, Penghui; Liu, Jing								Good influence transmission structure strengthens cooperation in prisoner's dilemma games								EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B				91	12					321	10.1140/epjb/e2018-90540-7					DEC 21 2018	2018	Analysis on how network reciprocity may help promote the coordination of agents in a system has attracted attention. However, designing effective methods for searching highly cooperative population structures remains a challenge. In this article, we reveal how cooperation behavior survives and spreads from a micro perspective, and further visualize the topology of influence transmission structure that supports the spread of cooperation. Based on our analysis, a highly cooperative multilevel scale-free network (mlSFNs) model is designed and compared with other existing scale-free network models. Meanwhile, we discover the positive correlation between influence coverage rate and cooperation level from a correlation analysis toward mass sample data. Thus, we introduce one rule for highly cooperative structures: influence coverage rate is essential to cooperation, while the unaffected nodes should be less influential. In our experiments, we find that this rule can provide effective guidance to the structure optimization algorithm termed fMA-C-PD-SFN, which successfully optimizes various structures subject to different strategy update rules. Moreover, fMA-C-PD-SFN is also applicable to the optimization of large-scale populations. In this case, we conclude that this rule is instructive for future design of a highly cooperative population structure.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1434-6028	1434-6036		WOS:000453935800001		J	Delahunt, Charles B.; Riffell, Jeffrey A.; Kutz, J. Nathan								Biological Mechanisms for Learning: A Computational Model of Olfactory Learning in the Manduca sexta Moth, With Applications to Neural Nets								FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE				12						102	10.3389/fncom.2018.00102					DEC 19 2018	2018	The insect olfactory system, which includes the antennal lobe (AL), mushroom body (MB), and ancillary structures, is a relatively simple neural system capable of learning. Its structural features, which are widespread in biological neural systems, process olfactory stimuli through a cascade of networks where large dimension shifts occur from stage to stage and where sparsity and randomness play a critical role in coding. Learning is partly enabled by a neuromodulatory reward mechanism of octopamine stimulation of the AL, whose increased activity induces synaptic weight updates in the MB through Hebbian plasticity. Enforced sparsity in the MB focuses Hebbian growth on neurons that are the most important for the representation of the learned odor. Based upon current biophysical knowledge, we have constructed an end-to-end computational firing-rate model of the Manduca sexta moth olfactory system which includes the interaction of the AL and MB under octopamine stimulation. Our model is able to robustly learn new odors, and neural firing rates in our simulations match the statistical features of in vivo firing rate data. From a biological perspective, the model provides a valuable tool for examining the role of neuromodulators, like octopamine, in learning, and gives insight into critical interactions between sparsity, Hebbian growth, and stimulation during learning. Our simulations also inform predictions about structural details of the olfactory system that are not currently well-characterized. From a machine learning perspective, the model yields bio-inspired mechanisms that are potentially useful in constructing neural nets for rapid learning from very few samples. These mechanisms include high-noise layers, sparse layers as noise filters, and a biologically-plausible optimization method to train the network based on octopamine stimulation, sparse layers, and Hebbian growth.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1662-5188			WOS:000453816800001	30618694	J	Amamuddy, Olivier Sheik; Bishop, Nigel T.; Bishop, Ozlem Tastan				Tastan Bishop, Ozlem/J-3084-2016	Tastan Bishop, Ozlem/0000-0001-6861-7849			Characterizing early drug resistance-related events using geometric ensembles from HIV protease dynamics								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						17938	10.1038/s41598-018-36041-8					DEC 18 2018	2018	The use of antiretrovirals (ARVs) has drastically improved the life quality and expectancy of HIV patients since their introduction in health care. Several millions are still afflicted worldwide by HIV and ARV resistance is a constant concern for both healthcare practitioners and patients, as while treatment options are finite, the virus constantly adapts via complex mutation patterns to select for resistant strains under the pressure of drug treatment. The HIV protease is a crucial enzyme for viral maturation and has been a game changing drug target since the first application. Due to similarities in protease inhibitor designs, drug cross-resistance is not uncommon across ARVs of the same class. It is known that resistance against protease inhibitors is associated with a wider active site, but results from our large scale molecular dynamics simulations combined with statistical tests and network analysis further show, for the first time, that there are regions of local expansions and compactions associated with high levels of resistance conserved across eight different protease inhibitors visible in their complexed form within closed receptor conformations. The observed conserved expansion sites may provide an alternative drug-targeting site. Further, the method developed here is novel, supplementary to methods of variation analysis at sequence level, and should be applicable in analysing the structural consequences of mutations in other contexts using molecular ensembles.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000453547500020	30560871	J	Liu, Jian-Guo; Yang, Zhen-Hua; Li, Sheng-Nan; Yu, Chang-Rui				Liu, Jianguo/B-4492-2012				A generative model for the collective attention of the Chinese stock market investors								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				512				1175	1182		10.1016/j.physa.2018.08.036					DEC 15 2018	2018	Collective attention of investors maps the interests and intention of investors directly in the stock market. However, the evolution mechanism of the collective attention from the viewpoint of complex system is missing. In this paper, we empirically investigate the investor collective attention mechanism based on a best-known stock trading platform between 2014 and 2016. Taking the global and recent popularity effects into account, we introduce a generative model for the collective attention of millions of investors who are deciding their trading behavior among thousands of stocks in Chinese stock market. The experimental results show that the investor attention is more closely affected by recent attention, with the optimal case, when the memory effect parameter T = 10 and the recent popularity parameter gamma = 0.1, the model could regenerate the collective attention more accurately, say Kendall's tau = 0.92 for the Shanghai Stock Exchange(SSE) and Shenzhen Stock Exchange(SZSE) simultaneously. This work may shed some lights for deeply understanding the mechanism of the investor collective attention for the financial market. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the full control of the edge dynamics may be neither feasible nor necessary in some real systems with huge size and complexity. This practical situation motivates us to explore target control, that is, the full control of a preselected subset of edges. In this paper, an effective method is proposed to approximate the minimum number of driver nodes sufficient for target control of the edge dynamics in complex networks. The method allows us not only to analyze the target control efficiency, i.e., a unified metric of the propensity of an edge dynamics to be target controllable, but also to show the structural property of driver nodes. Evaluation of real networks indicates that the target control efficiency is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. Simulation results and analytic calculations show that the edge dynamics in dense and homogeneous networks tend to have higher target control efficiency. Also, the target edge set selected by the random scheme is easier to control than that by the local scheme and the critical scheme. Furthermore, the analysis of the local structure of driver nodes shows that spare and inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real systems, tend to choose high-degree and divergent nodes as driver nodes.

Some classical methods, such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and coreness centrality, were reported to have some limitations in detecting influential nodes. Recently, the famous h-index was introduced to the network world to evaluate the spreading ability of the nodes. However, this method always assigns too many nodes with the same value, which leads to a resolution limit problem in distinguishing the real influences of these nodes. In this paper, we propose a local h-index centrality (LH-index) method to identify and rank influential nodes in networks. The LH-index method simultaneously takes into account of h-index values of the node itself and its neighbors, which is based on the idea that a node connecting to more influential nodes will also be influential. Experimental analysis on stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and several networks demonstrates the effectivity of the LH-index method in identifying influential nodes in networks.

An empirical study of urban road connection properties								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				512				775	787		10.1016/j.physa.2018.08.115					DEC 15 2018	2018	This paper aims to discover how to connect with each other between roads from the perspective of degree-degree correlation in network science. Named street approach and stroke-like analysis were first combined to define the road from the perspective of the cognition of the residents. Then, we constructed a series of new measures to characterize urban road networks based on lane properties. We applied this method to the road network in Xiamen, China. Based on a standard method from statistical physics, we examined in more detail the distributions of these new measures and found that the original degree still conforms to the power-law distribution under this road definition. Then, a clear parity value classification was found in hierarchical measure, and both of them have a good performance in power-law fitting. For the improved degree and adjusted degree, their whole rounding estimates are in good agreement with the Gaussian distribution, and the power-law effect of their long tail is significant. In considering the connection properties of networks, no solo assortative or disassortative characteristic exists. Based on ANND (average nearest neighbour degree) and LC (link coefficient), they present a distinct segmentation property that is different from existing conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The change of efficiency caused by failures or attacks can be used to assess the robustness or resilience of networks. However, due to the uncertainties of failures or attacks, the lengths of the shortest paths and in turn efficiency in a disrupted network cannot be easily calculated. The normal practice in the literature is to estimate the efficiency in different scenarios by simulation. In this paper, we propose an analytical way to assess the efficiency of complex networks under failures and attacks using percolation theory. We find that the efficiency of an affected network is exactly the product of global connectivity and local connectivity, where global connectivity refers to the size of the giant component, and local connectivity represents the average number of neighbors with different distances. This approach not only provides a more efficient and systematic way to analyze efficiency, but also reveals the relation between efficiency and connectivity. We discuss the application of our approach to scale-free networks and random graphs. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We examine the growth dynamics and interlocking relationships found in the worldwide scientific prize network. We focus on understanding how the knowledge linkages among prizes and scientists' propensities for prizewinning relate to knowledge pathways between disciplines and stratification within disciplines. Our data cover more than 3,000 different scientific prizes in diverse disciplines and the career histories of 10,455 prizewinners worldwide for over 100 years. We find several key links between prizes and scientific advances. First, despite an explosive proliferation of prizes over time and across the globe, prizes are more concentrated within a relatively small group of scientific elites, and ties among elites are highly clustered, suggesting that a relatively constrained number of ideas and scholars push the boundaries of science. For example, 64.1% of prizewinners have won two prizes and 13.7% have won five or more prizes. Second, certain prizes strongly interlock disciplines and subdisciplines, creating key pathways by which knowledge spreads and is recognized across science. Third, genealogical and coauthorship networks predict who wins multiple prizes, which helps to explain the interconnectedness among celebrated scientists and their pathbreaking ideas.									2	0	0	1	0	2			0027-8424			WOS:000452866000050	30530666	J	Priel, Avner; Gordin, Miri; Philip, Hagit; Zilberberg, Alona; Efroni, Sol					Priel, Avner/0000-0002-4620-6376			Network Representation of T-Cell Repertoire - A Novel Tool to Analyze Immune Response to Cancer Formation								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				9						2913	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02913					DEC 11 2018	2018	The T cell repertoire potentially presents complexity compatible, or greater than, that of the human brain. T cell based immune response is involved with practically every part of human physiology, and high-throughput biology needed to follow the T-cell repertoire has made great leaps with the advent of massive parallel sequencing (1). Nevertheless, tools to handle and observe the dynamics of this complexity have only recently started to emerge [e.g., (2-4)] in parallel with sequencing technologies. Here, we present a network-based view of the dynamics of the T cell repertoire, during the course of mammary tumors development in a mouse model. The transition from the T cell receptor as a feature, to network-based clustering, followed by network-based temporal analyses, provides novel insights to the workings of the system and provides novel tools to observe cancer progression via the perspective of the immune system. The crux of the approach here is at the network-motivated clustering. The purpose of the clustering step is not merely data reduction and exposing structures, but rather to detect hubs, or attractors, within the T cell receptor repertoire that might shed light on the behavior of the immune system as a dynamic network. The Clone-Attractor is in fact an extension of the clone concept, i.e., instead of looking at particular clones we observe the extended clonal network by assigning clusters to graph nodes and edges to adjacent clusters (editing distance metric). Viewing the system as dynamical brings to the fore the notion of an attractors landscape, hence the possibility to chart this space and map the sample state at a given time to a vector in this large space. Based on this representation we applied two different methods to demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying changes in the repertoire that correlate with changes in the phenotype: (1) network analysis of the TCR repertoire in which two measures were calculated and demonstrated the ability to differentiate control from transgenic samples, and, (2) machine learning classifier capable of both stratifying control and trangenic samples, as well as to stratify pre-cancer and cancer samples.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1664-3224			WOS:000452863500001	30619277	J	Anderson, Taylor M.; Dragicevic, Suzana				Dragicevic, Suzana/D-7333-2017				Network-agent based model for simulating the dynamic spatial network structure of complex ecological systems								ECOLOGICAL MODELLING				389				19	32		10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.10.008					DEC 10 2018	2018	Non-spatial ecological networks provide insight into the organization and interaction between biological entities. More recently, biological dispersal is modelled using spatial networks, static sets of georeferenced habitat patches that connect based on a species' maximum dispersal distance. However, dispersal is complex, where spatial patterns at the landscape scale emerge from interactions between ecological entities and landscape features at much finer individual scales. Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational representation of complex systems capable of capturing this complexity. Therefore, this study develops a network-ABM (N-ABM) that combines network and complex systems theory to simulate complex evolving spatial networks. The developed N-ABM approach is implemented on the case study of the emerald ash borer (EAB) bark beetle using geospatial datasets in Ontario, Canada. The N-ABM generates dynamic spatial network structures that emerge from interactions between the EAB and tree agents at the individual scale. The resulting networks are analyzed using graph theory measures. Analysis of the results indicates a relationship between preferential attachment in insect host selection and the emergent scale-free network structure. The N-ABM approach can be used to represent dynamic ecological networks and provides insight into how network structure emerges from EAB dispersal dynamics, useful for forest management.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0304-3800	1872-7026		WOS:000452580100005		J	Shen, Ai-Zhong; Guo, Jin-Li; Wang, Jun-Fang; Suo, Qi								The influence of extortion strategies on the evolution of cooperation in the scale-free network								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	30					1850334	10.1142/S0217979218503344					DEC 10 2018	2018	Extortion strategies can unilaterally transcend any opponent's expected payoffs and promote cooperative behaviors in an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. However, extortion strategies have the evolutionary instability if the players game with uniform structure. In this paper, we study the influence of extortion on the evolution of cooperation in the scale-free network with the player's game payoffs calculated by average payoffs and the strategy update rule according to the replicator dynamics rule. Firstly, we study the stability of evolutionary game results after introducing the extortion strategy and the influence of evolution extortion on cooperation. In addition, we compare the results of our model with the donation games of the accumulated payoff in the BA networks. Moreover, we study the influence of the model parameters on game results. The results show that extortion can form long-term stable relationships with neighbors and the average payoffs' inhibiting effect of cooperative behaviors disappear after introducing the extortion strategies in the scale-free network. The smaller value of the extortion actor and the benefit factor have a greater effect on the stability density of the strategies but the initial strategy density does not.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0217-9792	1793-6578		WOS:000453519300006		J	Li, Xuequn; Zhou, Shuming; Lian, Guanqin; Chen, Gaolin; Liu, Jiafei								Heterogeneity of social network based on degree sequence and community								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B				32	30					18503319	10.1142/S0217979218503319					DEC 10 2018	2018	As we know, the scale-free property of networks implies that there are a great deal of nodes with low degree and a few with high degree in networks.

In many such systems, the spectrum of the underlying graph Laplacian plays a key role in controlling the matter or information flow. Spectral graph theory has traditionally prioritized analyzing unweighted networks with specified adjacency properties. Here, we introduce a complementary framework, providing a mathematically rigorous weighted graph construction that exactly realizes any desired spectrum. We illustrate the broad applicability of this approach by showing how designer spectra can be used to control the dynamics of various archetypal physical systems. Specifically, we demonstrate that a strategically placed gap induces generalized chimera states in Kuramoto-type oscillator networks, tunes or suppresses pattern formation in a generic Swift-Hohenberg model, and leads to persistent localization in a discrete Gross-Pitaevskii quantum network. Our approach can be generalized to design continuous band gaps through periodic extensions of finite networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2160-3308			WOS:000452680300001		J	Stopczynski, Arkadiusz; Pentland, Alex 'Sandy'; Lehmann, Sune					Lehmann, Sune/0000-0001-6099-2345			How Physical Proximity Shapes Complex Social Networks								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						17722	10.1038/s41598-018-36116-6					DEC 7 2018	2018	Social interactions among humans create complex networks and - despite a recent increase of online communication - the interactions mediated through physical proximity remain a fundamental way for people to connect. A common way to quantify the nature of the links between individuals is to consider repeated interactions: frequently occurring interactions indicate strong ties, such as friendships, while ties with low weights can indicate random encounters. Here we focus on a different dimension: rather than the strength of links, we study physical distance between individuals when a link is activated. The findings presented here are based on a dataset of proximity events in a population of approximately 500 individuals. To quantify the impact of the physical proximity on the dynamic network, we use a simulated epidemic spreading processes in two distinct networks of physical proximity. We consider the network of short-range interactions defined as d less than or similar to 1 meter, and the long-range which includes all interactions d less than or similar to 10 meters. Since these two networks arise from the same set of underlying behavioral data, we are able to quantitatively measure how the specific definition of the proximity network - short-range versus long-range - impacts the resulting network structure as well as spreading dynamics in epidemic simulations. We find that the short-range network - consistent with the literature - is characterized by densely-connected neighborhoods bridged by weak ties. More surprisingly, however, we show that spreading in the long-range network is quite different, mainly shaped by spurious interactions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2045-2322			WOS:000452635000024	30531809	J	Maciel, Cassio Macedo; Strunz, Walter T.; Galiceanu, Mircea								Quantum transport on modified multilayered spiderwebs								JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL				51	49					495301	10.1088/1751-8121/aae8ab					DEC 7 2018	2018	We consider continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) on modified multilayered spiderwebs (MMSs) and their application to quantum transport. Quantum transport efficiency is determined in terms of the exact and the average return probabilities and it is systematically studied for three kind of MMSs. First, we consider a single layer of modified spiderwebs and we introduce the parameter p, which controls the transition from a pure Cayley tree (p = 0.0) to a complete spiderweb (p = 1.0). Topologically, this transition corresponds to adding with probability p more links between nearest neighboring nodes from the same generation, when we start from a Cayley tree. By doing so, we observe an increase in the quantum efficiency and we notice that for all generation numbers its highest value is encountered when only one link is missing from each generation. In the second case we stack more modified spiderwebs on top of each other and interconnect them, obtaining an MMS network. In this case the quantum efficiency is further increased by more than two orders of magnitude. In the third case, we remove some interconnecting links between nearest neighboring layers with probability 1- q. For these kind of networks we encounter that the highest quantum efficiency does not correspond to q = 1.0, but to q approximate to 0.9, more precise when we remove a link between successive layers. For these networks and for a proper choice of parameters the quantum efficiency is further increased by several orders of magnitude.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1751-8113	1751-8121		WOS:000449517600001		J	Vermeer, Wouter; Koppius, Otto; Vervest, Peter					Vermeer, Wouter/0000-0002-9684-6347			The Radiation-Transmission-Reception (RTR) model of propagation: Implications for the effectiveness of network interventions								PLOS ONE				13	12					e0207865	10.1371/journal.pone.0207865					DEC 5 2018	2018	Propagating phenomena in networks have received significant amount of attention within various domains, ranging from contagion in epidemiology, to diffusion of innovations and social influence on behavior and communication. Often these studies attempt to model propagation processes in networks to create interventions that steer propagation dynamics towards desired or away from undesired outcomes. Traditionally, studies have used relatively simple models of the propagation mechanism. In most propagation models this mechanism is described as a monolithic process and a single parameter for the infection rate. Such a description of the propagation mechanism is a severe simplification of mechanisms described in various theoretical exchange theories and phenomena found in real world settings, and largely fails to capture the nuances present in such descriptions. Recent work has suggested that such a simplification may not be sufficient to explain observed propagation dynamics, as nuances of the mechanism of propagation can have a severe impact on its dynamics. This suggests a better understanding of the role of the propagation mechanism is desired. In this paper we put forward a novel framework and model for propagation, the RTR framework. This framework, based on communication theory, decomposes the propagation mechanism into three sub-processes; Radiation, Transmission and Reception (RTR). We show that the RTR framework provides a more detailed way for specifying and conceptually thinking about the process of propagation, aligns better with existing real world interventions, and allows for gaining new insights into effective intervention strategies. By decomposing the propagation mechanism, we show that the specifications of this mechanism can have significant impact on the effectiveness of network interventions. We show that for the same composite single-parameter specification, different decompositions in Radiation, Transmission and Reception yield very different effectiveness estimates for the same network intervention, from 30% less effective to 70% more effective. We find that the appropriate choice for intervention depends strongly on the decomposition of the propagation mechanism. Our findings highlight that a correct decomposition of the mechanism is a prerequisite for developing effective network intervention strategies, and that the use of monolithic models, which oversimplify the mechanism, can be problematic of supporting decisions related to network interventions. In contrast, by allowing more detailed specification of the propagation mechanism and enabling this mechanism to be linked to existing interventions, the RTR framework provides a valuable tool for those designing interventions and implementing interventions strategies.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1932-6203			WOS:000452212400070	30517162	J	Saxena, Akrati; Gera, Ralucca; Iyengar, S.

A heuristic approach to estimate nodes' closeness rank using the properties of real world networks								SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND MINING				9	1					3	10.1007/s13278-018-0545-7					DEC 5 2018	2018	Centrality measures capture the intuitive notion of the importance of a node in a network. Importance of a node can be a very subjective term and is defined based on the context and the application. Closeness centrality is one of the most popular centrality measures which quantifies how close a node is to every other node in the network. It considers the average distance of a given node to all the other nodes in a network and requires one to know the complete information of the network. To compute the closeness rank of a node, we first need to compute the closeness value of all the nodes, and then compare them to get the rank of the node. In this work, we address the problem of estimating the closeness centrality rank of a node without computing the closeness centrality values of all the nodes in the network. We provide linear time heuristic algorithms which run in O(m), versus the classical algorithm which runs in time O(m . n) ,where m is the number of edges and n is the number of nodes in the network. The proposed methods are applied to real-world networks, and their accuracy is measured using absolute and weighted error functions.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000452333700001		J	Gupta, Yayati; Iyengar, S.

Hence, the conventional epidemiological models fail to capture the heterogeneity of social networks and the complexity of information diffusion. Standard information diffusion models depend heavily on the micro-level parameters of the network like edge weights and implicit vulnerabilities of nodes towards information. Such parameters are rarely available because of the absence of large amounts of information diffusion data. Hence, modeling information diffusion remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we utilize the peculiar structure of the real-world social networks to derive useful insights into the micro-level parameters. We propose an artificial framework mimicking the real-world information diffusion. The framework includes (1) a synthetic network which structurally resembles a real-world social network and (2) a meme spreading model based on the penta-level classification of edges in the network. The experimental results prove that the synthetic network combined with the proposed spreading model is able to simulate a real-world meme diffusion. The framework is validated with the help of the diffusion data of the Higgs boson meme on Twitter and the datasets of several popular real-world social networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1869-5450	1869-5469		WOS:000452085200001		J	Dong, Suyalatu; Huang, Yong-Chang								A Class of Rumor Spreading Models with Population Dynamics								COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS				70	6			795	802		10.1088/0253-6102/70/6/795					DEC 2018	2018	Based on the characteristics of rumor spreading in online social networks, this paper proposes a new rumor spreading model.

We numerically simulate the rumor spreading process. The results of numerical simulation show that the improved SIS model can successfully characterize the rumor spreading behavior in online social networks.

It is shown that the temperature distribution in complex networks can be manipulated by the degrees of two heat source nodes, and the change of network topology can induce a transition between negative (disassortative) and positive (assortative) degree correlations. A positive degree correlation (assortativity) will enhance thermal transport, in contrast to the uncorrelated networks (zero degree correlation), while a negative degree correlation (disassortativity) will weaken it. The underlying mechanisms have been analyzed, and a possible realization of the model in a nanoscale system is briefly discussed.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0924-090X	1573-269X		WOS:000452180200050		J	Mastio, Matthieu; Zargayouna, Mandi; Scemama, Gerard; Rana, Omar				Zargayouna/K-7610-2012	Zargayouna/0000-0002-1221-8977			Two distribution methods for multiagent traffic simulations								SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY				89				35	47		10.1016/j.simpat.2018.09.005					DEC 2018	2018	Modeling and simulation play an important role in transportation networks analysis. With the widespread use of personalized real-lime information sources, the behavior of the simulation depends heavily on individual travelers reactions to the received information. As a consequence, it is relevant for the simulation model to be individual-centered, and multiagent simulation is the most promising paradigm in this context However, representing the movements of realistic numbers of travelers within reasonable execution times requires significant computational resources. It also requires relevant methods, architectures and algorithms that respect the characteristics of transportation networks. In this paper, we define two multiagent simulation models representing the existing sequential multiagent traffic simulations. The first model is fundamental diagram-based model, in which travelers do not interact directly and use a fundamental diagram of traffic flow to continuously compute their speeds. The second model is car-following based, in which travelers interact with their neighbors to adapt their speeds to their surrounding environment Then we define patterns to distribute these simulations in a high-performance environment The first is agent-based and distributes agents equally between available computation units. The second pattern is environment-based and partitions the environment over the different units. The results show that agent-based distribution is more efficient with fundamental diagram-based model simulations while environment-based distribution is more efficient with car following-based simulations.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1569-190X	1878-1462		WOS:000450450400003		J	Gharesifard, Bahman; Smith, Stephen L.

The global objective is to maximize a submodular function of the strategies chosen by each agent. When choosing a strategy, each agent has access to only a limited number of other agents' choices. For each of its strategies, an agent can evaluate its marginal contribution to the global objective given its information. The main objective is to investigate how this limitation of information about the strategies chosen by other agents affects the performance when agents make choices according to a local greedy algorithm. In particular, we provide lower bounds on the performance of greedy algorithms for submodular maximization, which depend on the clique number of a graph that captures the information structure. We also characterize graph-theoretic upper bounds in terms of the chromatic number of the graph. Finally, we demonstrate how certain graph properties limit the performance of the greedy algorithm. Simulations on several common models for random networks demonstrate our results.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2325-5870	2372-2533		WOS:000454245200012		J	Shakeri, Heman; Moradi-Jamei, Behnaz; Poggi-Corradini, Pietro; Albin, Nathan; Scoglio, Caterina								Generalization of effective conductance centrality for egonetworks								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				511				127	138		10.1016/j.physa.2018.07.039					DEC 1 2018	2018	We study the popular centrality measure known as effective conductance or in some circles as information centrality. This is an important notion of centrality for undirected networks, with many applications, e.g., for random walks, electrical resistor networks, epidemic spreading, etc. In this paper, we first reinterpret this measure in terms of modulus (energy) of families of walks on the network. This modulus centrality measure coincides with the effective conductance measure on simple undirected networks, and extends it to much more general situations, e.g., directed networks as well. Secondly, we study a variation of this modulus approach in the egocentric network paradigm. Egonetworks are networks formed around a focal node (ego) with a specific order of neighborhoods. We propose efficient analytical and approximate methods for computing these measures on both undirected and directed networks. Finally, we describe a simple method inspired by the modulus point-of-view, called shell degree, which proved to be a useful tool for network science. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, the discovery of vital nodes in complex networks has captured increasing attention due to their important theoretical significance and great practicability. By defining the confidence of the node and the inter-node attraction, the significance of the node is measured by the product of the confidence of the node and the aggregation of attractions of the node on other nodes in the network. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed method has higher precision and performs well on various networks with different structures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0129-1831	1793-6586		WOS:000456681800009		J	Kundu, Suprateek; Ming, Jin; Pierce, Jordan; McDowell, Jennifer; Guo, Ying								Estimating dynamic brain functional networks using multi-subject fMRI data								NEUROIMAGE				183				635	649		10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.07.045					DEC 2018	2018	A common assumption in the study of brain functional connectivity is that the brain network is stationary. However it is increasingly recognized that the brain organization is prone to variations across the scanning session, fueling the need for dynamic connectivity approaches. One of the main challenges in developing such approaches is that the frequency and change points for the brain organization are unknown, with these changes potentially occurring frequently during the scanning session. In order to provide greater power to detect rapid connectivity changes, we propose a fully automated two-stage approach which pools information across multiple subjects to estimate change points in functional connectivity, and subsequently estimates the brain networks within each state phase lying between consecutive change points. The number and positioning of the change points are unknown and learned from the data in the first stage, by modeling a time-dependent connectivity metric under a fused lasso approach. In the second stage, the brain functional network for each state phase is inferred via sparse inverse covariance matrices. We compare the performance of the method with existing dynamic connectivity approaches via extensive simulation studies, and apply the proposed approach to a saccade block task fMRI data.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1053-8119	1095-9572		WOS:000447750200056	30048750	J	Wu, Taocheng; Wu, Jiajing; You, Wei								Optimizing robustness of complex networks with heterogeneous node functions based on the Memetic Algorithm								PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				511				143	153		10.1016/j.physa.2018.07.042					DEC 1 2018	2018	Cascading failure is an ubiquitous phenomenon in many types of complex networks, and it has attracted significant concerns in the past decade. In this paper, we consider a generic transmission network consisting of two kinds of nodes, i.e., hosts and routers, and only the hosts can generate and receive packets. In such a host-router network model, the network robustness against cascading failure is closely related to the hosts' locations. We employ the memetic algorithm (MA) to find a near-optimal way to locate the hosts, which remarkably improves the network robustness compared with three degree-based methods. Furthermore, we investigate the optimal configuration of the hosts given by the MA algorithm and put forward a faster method to select the hosts. This work provides a start point for systematically analyzing and optimizing network robustness of complex networks with heterogeneous node functions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) captures the dynamics of GRN. Algorithms combining the RNN and machine learning schemes were proposed to reconstruct small-scale GRNs using gene expression time series.ResultsWe present new GRN reconstruction methods with neural networks. The RNN is extended to a class of recurrent multilayer perceptrons (RMLPs) with latent nodes. Our methods contain two steps: the edge rank assignment step and the network construction step. The former assigns ranks to all possible edges by a recursive procedure based on the estimated weights of wires of RNN/RMLP (RERNN/RERMLP), and the latter constructs a network consisting of top-ranked edges under which the optimized RNN simulates the gene expression time series. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to optimize the parameters of RNNs and RMLPs in a two-step algorithm. The proposed RERNN-RNN and RERMLP-RNN algorithms are tested on synthetic and experimental gene expression time series of small GRNs of about 10 genes. The experimental time series are from the studies of yeast cell cycle regulated genes and E. coli DNA repair genes.ConclusionThe unstable estimation of RNN using experimental time series having limited data points can lead to fairly arbitrary predicted GRNs. Our methods incorporate RNN and RMLP into a two-step structure learning procedure. Results show that the RERMLP using the RMLP with a suitable number of latent nodes to reduce the parameter dimension often result in more accurate edge ranks than the RERNN using the regularized RNN on short simulated time series. Combining by a weighted majority voting rule the networks derived by the RERMLP-RNN using different numbers of latent nodes in step one to infer the GRN, the method performs consistently and outperforms published algorithms for GRN reconstruction on most benchmark time series. The framework of two-step algorithms can potentially incorporate with different nonlinear differential equation models to reconstruct the GRN.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1913-2751	1867-1462		WOS:000451751300016	28748400	J	Chica, Manuel; Chiong, Raymond; Kirley, Michael; Ishibuchi, Hisao				Chica, Manuel/F-6062-2011	Chica, Manuel/0000-0002-4717-1056; Kirley, Michael/0000-0002-6030-858X; Chiong, Raymond/0000-0002-8285-1903			A Networked N-Player Trust Game and Its Evolutionary Dynamics								IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION				22	6			866	878		10.1109/TEVC.2017.2769081					DEC 2018	2018	Trust and trustworthiness are of great importance in social and human systems, especially when considering managerial and economic decision-making. In this paper, we investigate the emergent dynamics of an evolutionary game-theoretic model-the N-player evolutionary trust game-consisting of three types of players: 1) an investor; 2) a trustee who is trustworthy; and 3) a trustee who is untrustworthy. Here, we limit the interactions between players to local neighborhoods defined by a specific spatial topology or social network. Players are able to adjust their game-playing strategies using an evolutionary update rule based on the payoffs obtained by their neighbors. Through comprehensive simulation experiments, we find that trust can be promoted when players interact on a social network despite a substantial number of untrustworthy individuals in the initial population. These results differ from findings reported for an unstructured population of the same game, where the existence of a single untrustworthy individual would eliminate trust completely. We compare the dynamics of the model with different social network densities and structures (e.g., from regular lattices to scale-free and random networks). We observe that the levels of trust vary under different network structures, and the level is correlated with how "difficult" the game is. When game conditions are easy (i.e., low temptation to defect and/or almost no initial untrustworthy trustees), homogeneous networks with higher densities can promote higher levels of trust. However, when the game becomes harder, heterogeneous social networks with lower densities are able to promote higher levels of trust and global net wealth.									1	0	0	0	0	1			1089-778X	1941-0026		WOS:000451911500004		J	Miller, William B., Jr.; Torday, John S.

From that initiating platform, a cohesive alternative evolutionary narrative distinct from standard Neodarwinism can be presented. Cognition-Based Evolution contends that biological variation is a product of a self-reinforcing information cycle that derives from self-referential attachment to biological information space-time with its attendant ambiguities. That information cycle is embodied through obligatory linkages among energy, biological information, and communication. Successive reiterations of the information cycle enact the informational architectures of the basic unicellular forms. From that base, inter-domain and cell-cell communications enable genetic and cellular variations through self-referential natural informational engineering and cellular niche construction. Holobionts are the exclusive end-points of that self-referential cellular engineering as obligatory multicellular combinations of the essential Four Domains: Prokaryota, Archaea, Eukaryota and the Virome. Therefore, it is advocated that these Four Domains represent the perpetual object of the living circumstance rather than the visible macroorganic forms. In consequence, biology and its evolutionary development can be appraised as the continual defense of instantiated cellular self-reference. As the survival of cells is as dependent upon limitations and boundaries as upon any freedom of action, it is proposed that selection represents only one of many forms of cellular constraint that sustain self-referential integrity.

A Connectomic Atlas of the Human Cerebrum-Chapter 1: Introduction, Methods, and Significance								OPERATIVE NEUROSURGERY				15				S1	S9		10.1093/ons/opy253				1	DEC 2018	2018	BACKGROUND: As knowledge of the brain has increased, clinicians have learned that the cerebrum is composed of complex networks that interact to execute key functions. While neurosurgeons can typically predict and preserve primary cortical function through the primary visual and motor cortices, preservation of higher cognitive functions that are less well localized in regions previously deemed "silent" has proven more difficult. This suggests these silent cortical regions are more anatomically complex and redundant than our previous methods of inquiry can explain, and that progress in cerebral surgery will be made with an improved understanding of brain connectomics. Newly published parcellated cortex maps provide one avenue to study such connectomics in greater detail, and they provide a superior framework and nomenclature for studying cerebral function and anatomy.OBJECTIVE: To describe the structural and functional aspects of the 180 distinct areas that comprise the human cortex model previously published under the Human Connectome Project (HCP).METHODS: We divided the cerebrum into 8 macroregions: lateral frontal, motor/premotor, medial frontal, insular, temporal, lateral parietal, medial parietal, and occipital. These regions were further subdivided into their relevant parcellations based on the HCP cortical scheme. Connectome Workbench was used to localize parcellations anatomically and to demonstrate their functional connectivity. DSI studio was used to assess the structural connectivity for each parcellation.RESULTS: The anatomy, functional connectivity, and structural connectivity of all 180 cortical parcellations identified in the HCP are compiled into a single atlas. Within each section of the atlas, we integrate this information, along with what is known about parcellation function to summarize the implications of these data on network connectivity.CONCLUSION: This multipart supplement aims to build on the work of the HCP. We present this information in the hope that the complexity of cerebral connectomics will be conveyed in a more manageable format that will allow neurosurgeons and neuroscientists to accurately communicate and formulate hypotheses regarding cerebral anatomy and connectivity.

The single line failure leads either to an insignificant power loss or to a cascade which causes a major blackout with yield less than 0.8. The former occurs with high probability if line tolerance alpha (the ratio of the maximal load a line can carry to its initial load) is greater than 2, while a major blackout occurs with high probability in a broad range of 1 < alpha < 2. We also show that major blackouts begin with a latent period (with duration proportional to alpha) during which few lines overload and yield remains high. The existence of the latent period suggests that intervention during early stages of a cascade can significantly reduce the risk of a major blackout. Finally, we introduce the preferential Degree And Distance Attachment model to generate random networks with similar degree, resistance, and flow distributions to the USWI. Moreover, we show that the Degree And Distance Attachment model behaves similarly to the USWI against failures.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2050-1242	2050-1250		WOS:000457177800002		J	Vicente, Jerome; Balland, Pierre-Alexandre; Crespo, Joan				Vicente, Jerome/H-5784-2011	Vicente, Jerome/0000-0003-2556-2061			The micro foundations of regional structural change What do we learn from 25 years of proximity research?								REVUE D ECONOMIE REGIONALE ET URBAINE					5-6			1013	1040							DEC 2018	2018	The paper focuses on the contributions of twenty-five years of research on proximity dynamics in terms of their contribution to the foundations and analysis of structural change at the reginal level. It considers that, despite significant progress, there are still shadow zones in the link between the microeconomic determinants of the formation of proximity links and macro-regional dynamics. The article shows that the analysis of the structural properties of the networks makes it possible to clarify this articulation and to reduce the observed gap between micro and macro-based researches of proximity dynamics. By associating the dynamics of structural change of the regions with the evolution of the architecture of their networks, it suggests to look for the micro-foundations of these dynamics in the articulation of three distinct registers of proximity. The perspectives opened are discussed in the context of three research programs and public policy that have emerged in recent years (regional resilience, smart specialization, cluster policies).									0	0	0	0	0	0			0180-7307	2107-0865		WOS:000456881900005		J	Chen, Huiping; Chen, Huixuan								PARAMETERS OF MULTIFRACTAL SPECTRUM FOR DESCRIBING GROWTH STATE OF SOYBEAN LEAVES								FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY				26	6					1850090	10.1142/S0218348X18500901					DEC 2018	2018	We studied soybean leaves of the main soybean cultivars and their mutants from Shanxi Province, China, using multifractal spectrum analysis of transmission scanned gray scale images of excised leaves. We demonstrate that the parameters of multifractal spectra correlate with the biological status of the plant. The width Delta alpha of the multifractal spectrum, a parameter of the transmission scanned gray scale image, is a good indicator of the metabolic state arid growth rate of a soybean leaf. In general, the larger the value of Delta alpha, the more exuberant the metabolism and the faster the growth rate of the leaf. alpha(min) is a parameter related with the distribution of chlorophyll in leaf, it reflects the concentration degree of chlorophyll; the smaller the value of alpha(min), the higher the concentration degree of chlorophyll in the leaf. alpha(max) is a parameter related with the distribution of water in the leaf, it reflects the concentration degree of water; the larger the value of alpha(max), the higher the concentration degree of water in the leaf. In order to reduce the impact of errors in the calculation of Delta alpha, alpha(min) and alpha(max), we introduced three new parameters - the characteristic width Delta alpha(C), the characteristic alpha(S) and the characteristic alpha(L). We compare the values of Delta alpha, alpha(min) and alpha(max) among the different leaves qualitatively by replacing Delta alpha, alpha(min) and alpha(max) with Delta alpha(C), alpha(S) and alpha(L), respectively. In research of soybean leaf growth, stress resistance of soybean cultivars and the breeding of excellent varietals, Delta alpha(C) is shown here to be a new and useful indicator for analysis.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0218-348X	1793-6543		WOS:000456012600007		J	Yang, Jin-Xuan								Epidemic spreading in multiplex networks with heterogeneous infection rate								EPL				124	5					58004	10.1209/0295-5075/124/58004					DEC 2018	2018	The awareness behaviour prevents infection, and the epidemic spreading affects awareness spreading. The interactions between human awareness and epidemic spreading are often described in terms of multiplex networks. Many studies have revealed the heterogeneity of infection rates due to different health habits, social conditions, physical strength, and contact frequency between individuals. In this paper, we consider the epidemic spreading process in multiplex networks with heterogeneous infection rate. We construct a heterogeneous infection rate function whose tunable power exponent is related to the degree of the node. The epidemic threshold is obtained by the Markov chain and mean-field approach. Numerical simulations of scale-free, small-world and random networks show that the fraction of infected individuals and epidemic threshold arc affected by the power exponent, and the negative heterogeneous infection rate is more conducive to preventing epidemic. Immunization of hub nodes is a good method to mitigate an epidemic.

Human society is based to a large extent on mechanisms that favor cooperation. Indirect reciprocity is a crucial factor for the emergence and maintenance of cooperation in evolutionary games. In this work, we introduce a mechanism of heterogeneous indirect reciprocity in the prisoner's dilemma game, where an altruistic attribute is considered. The so-called altruistic attribute refers to the trait that when an altruistic individual cooperates, its neighbors, regardless of their strategies, can gain additional benefits. Intuitively, altruistic cooperative agents seem to do only what is beneficial for others, but in fact, their neighbors tend to cooperate in order to maintain the cooperative strategies of altruistic individuals. In this way, the neighbors of cooperative altruistic individuals not only guarantee their own additional benefits, but also indirectly protect the income of altruistic individuals, which strengthens the links between cooperative individuals, thus promoting the evolution of cooperation. The robustness of the results is verified on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. Moreover, the results of individual heterogeneity corroborate the existing evidence that heterogeneity, almost irrespective of its origin, promotes cooperative actions. Our conclusions might provide additional insights into understanding the roots of cooperation in social systems.

Current reconstruction approaches were mainly proposed to infer the unsigned networks. However, many social relationships, such as friends and foes, can be represented as signed social networks that contain positive and negative links. To the best of our knowledge, the method of reconstructing signed networks has not yet been developed. To this purpose, we develop a statistical inference approach to fully reconstruct the signed network structure (positive links, negative links, and nonexistent links) based on the Ising dynamics. By the theoretical analysis, we show that our approach can transfer the problem of maximum likelihood estimation into the problem of solving linear systems of equations, where the solution of the linear system of equations uncovers the neighbors and the signs of links of each node. The experimental results on both synthetic and empirical networks validate the reliability and efficiency of our method. Our study moves the first step toward reconstructing signed networks.

Contemporary studies of city networks have tended to focus on economic interactions without paying sufficient attention to the issue of knowledge flow. Using data on co-authored papers obtained from China Academic Journal Network Publishing Database (CAJNPD) during 2014-2016, this study explores several features of the scientific collaboration network between Chinese mainland cities. The study concludes that: (1) the spatial organization of scientific cooperation amongst Chinese cities is shifting from a jurisdiction-based hierarchical system to a networked system; and (2) several highly intra-connected city regions were found to exist in the network of knowledge, and such regions had more average internal linkages (14.21) than external linkages (8.69), and higher average internal linkage degrees (14.43) than external linkage degrees (10.43); and (3) differences existed in terms of inter-region connectivity between the Western, Eastern, and Central China regional networks (the average INCD of the three regional networks were 109.65, 95.81, and 71.88). We suggest that China should engage in the development of regional and sub-regional scientific centers to achieve the goal of building an innovative country. Whilst findings reveal a high degree of concentration in those networks - a characteristic which reflects the hierarchical nature of China's urban economic structure - the actual spatial distribution of city networks of knowledge flow was found to be different from that of city networks based on economic outputs or population.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1009-637X	1861-9568		WOS:000455924200004		J	Jordan, Jonathan								PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT GRAPHS WITH CO-EXISTING TYPES OF DIFFERENT FITNESSES								JOURNAL OF APPLIED PROBABILITY				55	4			1211	1227		10.1017/jpr.2018.80					DEC 2018	2018	We extend the work of Antunovic et al.

We show that, depending on the values of the parameters of the models, there are different possible limiting behaviours depending on the zeros of a certain function. In particular, we show the existence of choices of the parameters where one type is favoured both by having higher fitness and by the type of attachment mechanism, but the other type has a positive probability of dominating the network in the limit.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0021-9002	1475-6072		WOS:000455885000015		J	Lamali, Mohamed Lamine; Fergani, Nasreddine; Cohen, Johanne								Algorithmic and Complexity Aspects of Path Computation in Multi-Layer Networks								IEEE-ACM TRANSACTIONS ON NETWORKING				26	6			2787	2800		10.1109/TNET.2018.2878103					DEC 2018	2018	Carrier-grade networks comprise several layers where different protocols coexist. Nowadays, most of these networks have different control planes to manage routing on different layers, leading to a suboptimal use of the network resources and to additional operational costs. However, some routers are able to encapsulate, decapsulate, and convert protocols, and act as a liaison between these layers. A unified control plane would be useful to optimize the use of the network resources and to automate the routing configurations. Software-defined networking-based architectures offer an opportunity to design such a control plane. One of the most important problems to deal with in this design is the path computation process. Classical path computation algorithms cannot resolve the problem, as they do not take into account encapsulations and conversions of protocols. In this paper, we propose algorithms to solve this problem and study several cases. If there is no bandwidth constraint, we propose a polynomial algorithm that computes the optimal path. We also give lower and upper bounds on the optimal path length. On the other hand, we show that the problem is NP-hard if there is a bandwidth constraint (or other quality-of-service parameters), even if there is only two protocols and in a symmetric graph. We study the complexity and the scalability of our algorithms and evaluate their performances on real and random topologies. The results show that they are faster than the previous ones proposed in the literature. These algorithms can also have important applications in automatic tunneling.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1063-6692	1558-2566		WOS:000454237000027		J	Nagy, Laszlo; Ormos, Mihaly				Ormos, Mihaly/E-1051-2011	Ormos, Mihaly/0000-0002-3224-7636			Friendship of Stock Market Indices: A Cluster-Based Investigation of Stock Markets								JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT				11	4					88	10.3390/jrfm11040088					DEC 2018	2018	This paper introduces a spectral clustering-based method to show that stock prices contain not only firm but also network-level information.

Socio-Technical Integration of Nuclear Waste Geological Disposal Systems								SUSTAINABILITY				10	12					4390	10.3390/su10124390					DEC 2018	2018	We present a new perspective on geological disposal systems for nuclear waste. Geological disposal systems encompass all the processes required for the permanent isolation of highly-radioactive materials from humans and the biosphere. Radioactive materials requiring geological disposal are created by commercial nuclear power plants, research reactors, and defense-related nuclear activities, such as spent nuclear fuel from commercial reactors and high-level waste from reprocessing to reclaim fissile material for weapons. We show that disposal systems are so complex that new methods of representation are required. Despite the common call for a systems approach, a broader perspective is needed to obtain an integrated view of disposal systems. We introduce a conceptual formalism of geological disposal systems based on a multi-scale integrated analysis approach. This metabolic' representation allows one to account for the technical complexity of disposal systems in relation to their broader societal context. Although the paper is conceptual, the integrated formalism can improve the understanding of the complexity of disposal systems and their policy requirements by connecting technical solutions with societal constraints. However, the paper also reveals the limits to efforts to integrate technical and social dimensions of geological disposal systems into a single formalism.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2071-1050			WOS:000455338100056		J	Zhang, Xin-Jie; Tang, Yong; Xiong, Jason; Wang, Wei-Jia; Zhang, Yi-Cheng								Dynamics of Cooperation in Minority Games in Alliance Networks								SUSTAINABILITY				10	12					4746	10.3390/su10124746					DEC 2018	2018	Alliance networks are the underlying structures of social systems in business, management, and society. The sustainability and dynamics of a social system rely on the structural evolutions of the topologies. Understanding the evolution sheds light on the dynamics and sustainability of a social system. Minority game models have been successfully applied across social science, economy, management, and engineering. They provide simple yet applicable modeling to articulate the evolutionary cooperation dynamics of competitive players in binary decision situations. By extending the minority games played in alliance networks, the cooperation in structured systems of different network topologies is analyzed. In this model, local and global score strategies are considered with and without cooperation rewiring options. The cooperation level, the score, and the topological properties are investigated. The research uses a numerical simulation approach on random networks, scale-free networks, and small-world networks. The results suggest that the network rewiring strategy leads to higher systemic performance with a higher score and a higher level of stability in decision-making. Competitive decision-making can lead to a higher level of cooperation from a poor initial start. However, stubbornness in decision-making can lead to a poor situation when cooperation is discouraged. Players with local or global information adopt local and global score strategies. The results show that local strategies might lead to imbalance, while a global strategy might achieve a relatively stable outcome. This work contributes to bridge minority games in structured networks to study the cooperation between formation and evolution, and calls for future minority game modeling on social networks.									1	0	0	0	0	1			2071-1050			WOS:000455338100412		J	Naef, Ahmed; Abdullah, Rosni; Rashid, Nur'Aini Abdul								Multiobjective optimization to reconstruct biological networks								BIOSYSTEMS				174				22	36		10.1016/j.biosystems.2018.09.003					DEC 2018	2018	Automated methods for reconstructing biological networks are becoming increasingly important in computational systems biology. Public databases containing information on biological processes for hundreds of organisms are assisting in the inference of such networks. This paper proposes a multiobjective genetic algorithm method to reconstruct networks related to metabolism and protein interaction. Such a method utilizes structural properties of scale-free networks and known biological information about individual genes and proteins to reconstruct metabolic networks represented as enzyme graph and protein interaction networks. We test our method on four commonly-used protein networks in yeast. Two are networks related to the metabolism of the yeast: KEGG and BioCyc. The other two datasets are networks from protein-protein interaction: Krogan and BioGrid. Experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of reconstructing biological networks by combining different omics data and structural characteristics of scale-free networks. However, the proposed method to reconstruct the network is time-consuming because several evaluations must be performed. We parallelized this method on GPU to overcome this limitation by parallelizing the objective functions of the presented method. The parallel method shows a significant reduction in the execution time over the GPU card which yields a 492-fold speedup.									0	0	0	0	0	0			0303-2647	1872-8324		WOS:000454967700002	30236951	J	Jung, Hohyun; Lee, Jae-Gil; Lee, Namgil; Kim, Sung-Ho								Comparison of fitness and popularity: fitness-popularity dynamic network model								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										123403	10.1088/1742-5468/aaeb40					DEC 2018	2018	Dynamic networks are ubiquitous in the world. So far, many dynamic network models have been developed in search of network growth mechanisms at the node and edge levels. Especially, a number of fitness models have been employed for analysis of fitness (i.e. a node's inherent ability or characteristics) and popularity effects on growing networks. However, these models are not suitable for comparing the magnitude of the fitness and popularity effects. We propose a statistical dynamic network model called a fitness-popularity dynamic network (FPDN) model, where fitness and popularity effects are on equal footing. These effects are estimated under the FPDN model and the estimation procedure are applied to the network data, Flickr following, Facebook wallpost, and arXiv citation. The estimates of the two effects seem to represent the characters of the three networks with noteworthy interpretations. It is interesting to see that the popularity of a node negatively affects the growth of the in-degree of the node for the arXiv citation network while the effect is positive for the other networks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000453344600002		J	Armstrong, Margaret; Petter, Renato; Petter, Carlos					Petter, Renato/0000-0003-2479-2527			Going Viral: How attacks in social media can erode confidence in mining.

From there the mud made its way to the Rio Doce river system, killing fish and frogs, and causing massive pollution down to the mouth 650 km away. A year later a yellow fever outbreak occurred in the same state in Brazil, with 450 confirmed cases and about 150 deaths. After newspapers reported the yellow fever cases, online blogs started suggesting that the outbreak might have been caused by the Samarco disaster and citing comments by well-known scientists. Twelve months later another yellow fever outbreak occurred, and the online bloggers repeated the same claims, but the wording changed.In this paper we analyze the timing of the online activity, using Google search to find all the postings in the press and in social media with the two terms, "Samarco" and "Febre Amarela" (yellow fever, in Portuguese). In 2017, most postings faithfully reported what the scientists had said, but in 2018, some postings started making stronger claims than the scientists originally had. After analyzing the content of the postings, we construct two directed networks, one for 2017 and the other for 2018, to show to which scientists the postings refer and to illustrate the subtle and not so subtle distortions that started to creep in. In the conclusion we ask how the rise in hostility to mining expressed in some of these blogs should be interpreted. Is it just the usual low-level dislike of the extractive industries or are these the precursor symptoms of a more general refusal to accept mining in Brazil?									0	0	0	0	0	0			0301-4207	1873-7641		WOS:000454974900034		J	Zhou, Ming-Yang; Xiong, Wen-Man; Liao, Hao; Wang, Tong; Wei, Zong-Wen								Empirical paths to the spread of information in location-based social networks								JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT										123404	10.1088/1742-5468/aae849					DEC 2018	2018	Spreading phenomena in complex networks have attracted much attention in recent years. However, most of the previous works only concern the critical thresholds and final states of the spread. In this paper, we investigate the empirical spreading paths in real location-based networks and find an abnormal phenomenon that the transferring probability of an epidemic between users varies with time, which violates the classical spreading models with a constant transferring probability. Besides, we observe an interesting delay gap between the maximal spreading velocity and the maximal transferring probability, where the spreading velocity refers to the fraction of newly infected nodes, and transferring probability represents the probability that a susceptible individual gets infected by one of its infected neighbors. Then we propose an advanced SI (susceptible-infected) model to analyze the problem, which could analytically explain the delay gap between the spreading velocity and the transferring probability. Experiments in BA and ER model networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. Thus, our work provides a deep understanding of the dynamics of the spreading problems.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1742-5468			WOS:000453850800001		J	Schluter, Magdalen G.; Kim, Hyoun S.; Hodgins, David C.

Therefore, we examined the reliability and validity of three behavioral tasks of impulsivity common in addiction research in a sample of individuals with a current or past history of problem gambling recruited online. Methods: Using a two-stage recruitment process, a final sample of 110 participants with a history of problem or disordered gambling were recruited through MTurk and completed self-report questionnaires of gambling involvement symptomology, a Delay Discounting Task (DDT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), Cued Go/No-Go Task, and the UPPS-P. Results: Participants demonstrated logically consistent responding on the DDT. The area under the empirical discounting curve (AUC) ranged from 0.02 to 0.88 (M = 0.23). The BART demonstrated good split-third reliability (rho s = 0.67 to 0.78). The tasks generally showed small correlations with each other (rho s = +/- 0.06 to 0.19) and with UPPS-P subscales (rho s = +/- 0.01 to 0.20). Discussion and conclusions: The behavioral tasks demonstrated good divergent validity. Correlation magnitudes between behavioral tasks and UPPS-P scales and mean scores on these measures were generally consistent with the existing literature. Behavioral tasks of impulsivity appear to have utility for use with problem and disordered gambling samples collected online, allowing researchers a cost efficient and rapid avenue for conducting behavioral research with gamblers. We conclude with best-practice recommendations for using behavioral tasks using crowdsourcing samples.									2	0	0	0	0	2			2062-5871	2063-5303		WOS:000454636900033	30613126	J	[Anonymous]								The subtle success of a complex mindset								NATURE PHYSICS				14	12			1149	1149		10.1038/s41567-018-0386-3					DEC 2018	2018										0	0	0	0	0	0			1745-2473	1745-2481		WOS:000454726800001		J	Babutsidze, Zakaria								The rise of electronic social networks and implications for advertisers								TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE				137				27	39		10.1016/j.techfore.2018.06.010					DEC 2018	2018	The rise of modern digital communication technologies, most notably electronic social networks, transforms structures through which consumers interact with one another. In this paper we distinguish between two channels through which product promotion affects sales. The direct channel always positively affects consumers' pre-purchase valuation. The indirect channel goes through word-of-mouth (WoM) and can be either positive or negative. The sentiment contained in WoM is generated by the complex interaction process and depends on the aggressiveness of the advertising campaign. We investigate the implications of the current changes in social network architectures for the effectiveness of the indirect channel. We show that changes in social structures have increased the efficiency of WoM across a host of industries.

Macroeconomic models typically build on complete connectedness among economic actors (frictionless flow of information, perfect information on prices), thus these models typically oversee the possible effects of complex, incomplete network structures among economic agents on emergent macroeconomic phenomena. In this paper we try to fill this gap by incorporating possibly incomplete relationship structures between economic actors in a standard model of monopolistic competition and then analyze the effect of different network structures on the equilibrium and dynamic properties of the model. Analytical and simulation results of the model show that incomplete connectedness give rise to deadweight loss, shrinking output below the level observed in standard models with complete networks. Also, the dynamics of link formation has an effect on the steady state of the economy as well as on its response to shocks.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1385-9587	1573-7071		WOS:000454495100002		J	Boersma, Marcel; Sourabh, Sumit; Hoogduin, Lucas; Kandhai, Drona								Financial statement networks: an application of network theory in the audit								JOURNAL OF NETWORK THEORY IN FINANCE				4	4			59	85		10.21314/JNTF.2018.048					DEC 2018	2018	Auditors use predictive models to estimate financial account values in a financial statement. Prior studies suggest that incorporating organizational knowledge into these models yields better predictive accuracy. We propose a novel method to construct a financial statement network in order to gain insight into the organizational structure of a company using real financial transaction data from ten companies. We show that real data yields financial statement networks of varying complexity. We introduce a method to aggregate the nodes and edges of the financial statement network, which results in its visualization at the right level of tractability. We also show that this visualization enables the auditor to assess the complexity of the organizational structure of a company and to use it as a risk indicator for the audit. Further, the obtained network yields insights into the monetary flow between financial accounts and business processes. We show that this information can be used to add organizational knowledge to predictive models for the purpose of obtaining audit evidence.									0	0	0	0	0	0			2055-7795	2055-7809		WOS:000454411400004		J	Morzy, Mikolaj; Kajdanowicz, Tomasz				Morzy, Mikolaj/I-8489-2016	Morzy, Mikolaj/0000-0002-2905-9538			Graph Energies of Egocentric Networks and Their Correlation with Vertex Centrality Measures								ENTROPY				20	12					916	10.3390/e20120916					DEC 2018	2018	Graph energy is the energy of the matrix representation of the graph, where the energy of a matrix is the sum of singular values of the matrix. Depending on the definition of a matrix, one can contemplate graph energy, Randi energy, Laplacian energy, distance energy, and many others. Although theoretical properties of various graph energies have been investigated in the past in the areas of mathematics, chemistry, physics, or graph theory, these explorations have been limited to relatively small graphs representing chemical compounds or theoretical graph classes with strictly defined properties. In this paper we investigate the usefulness of the concept of graph energy in the context of large, complex networks. We show that when graph energies are applied to local egocentric networks, the values of these energies correlate strongly with vertex centrality measures. In particular, for some generative network models graph energies tend to correlate strongly with the betweenness and the eigencentrality of vertices. As the exact computation of these centrality measures is expensive and requires global processing of a network, our research opens the possibility of devising efficient algorithms for the estimation of these centrality measures based only on local information.									0	0	0	0	0	0			1099-4300			WOS:000454282000024		J	Asllani, Malbor; Lambiotte, Renaud; Carletti, Timoteo					Carletti, Timoteo/0000-0003-2596-4503; Lambiotte, Renaud/0000-0002-0583-4595; Asllani, Malbor/0000-0002-3335-429X			Structure and dynamical behavior of non-normal networks								SCIENCE ADVANCES				4	12					eaau9403	10.1126/sciadv.aau9403					DEC 2018	2018	We analyze a collection of empirical networks in a wide spectrum of disciplines and show that strong non-normality is ubiquitous in network science. Dynamical processes evolving on non-normal networks exhibit a peculiar behavior, as initial small disturbances may undergo a transient phase and be strongly amplified in linearly stable systems. In addition, eigenvalues may become extremely sensible to noise and have a diminished physical meaning. We identify structural properties of networks that are associated with non-normality and propose simple models to generate networks with a tunable level of non-normality. We also show the potential use of a variety of metrics capturing different aspects of non-normality and propose their potential use in the context of the stability of complex ecosystems.									3	0	0	1	0	3			2375-2548			WOS:000454369600043	30547090	J	Baggio, Rodolfo; Fuchs, Matthias								Network science and e-tourism								INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & TOURISM				20	1-4	SI		97	102		10.1007/s40558-018-0125-8					DEC 2018	2018										0	0	0	0	0	0			1098-3058	1943-4294		WOS:000453574300006
